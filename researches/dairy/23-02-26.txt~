=======================
THE USE OF OZONE TECHNOLOGY: 
AN ECO-FRIENDLY METHOD FOR THE SANITATION OF THE DAIRY SUPPLY CHAIN
=======================



1. intro
-----------------------

global cheese market:
	2019: ?????? billion, 20.98 million tons
	2020: $72.26 billion, 21.69 million tons
	2021: $192.81 billion (estimated)
	2022: $211.02 billion (estimated) 
		compound annual growht rate (CAGR) of 9.4%
	2026: $289.57 billion (estimated) 
		compound annual growht rate (CAGR) of 8.2%

	top producers in 2021:
		europe: 10 million tons
		usa: 6 million tons
		germany: 2.461.334 tons
		france: 1.716.120 tons
		italy: 1.197.390 tons

	top producer in europe - germany:
		drinking milk: 19.3% of europe
		butter: 21.0% of europe
		cheese: 22.9% of europe
		acidified mild products: 23.7% of europe

	[see table 1. for top cheese producers]
		
problems in the dairy industry:
	huge costs
	economic losses
	excessive product waste
	
	disinfection of the premises and equipment:
		large amount of water 
		steam at high temperatures
		chlorine-based chemical
	
	ex. ultra-high-temperature (UHT)-processed milk:
		uses a lot of chemicals
			alkaline cleaners
				NaOH
				HNO3
		results?
			costs for the disposal of wastewater
				for the sanitizers used
				for the production residues
			dairy waste waters (DWW)
				contains hinge levels of mineral
				and organin compounds
				bad for the soil and water
			conventionally, they are purified with
				physical-chemical
				biological methods
			1-10 L of wastewater per liter of produced milk

	percentage of dairy wastewater:
		49% cheese
		19% drinking milk
		18% acidified milk
		13% butterfat
		germany, france, italy, poland, spain, netherlands 73% of DWW

	common practice for the sanitation of water
		chlorine gas (Cl2)
		chlorine dioxide (ClO2)
		hypochlorite (ClO-)
	
	ozone is a viable alternative

	legislation for quality of water for human consumption
		EU directive 2020/2184 of 21 December 2021
		replacing the old 98/83 directive

		the new directive is to monitor some by-products of chlorine
			chlorates
			haloacetic acids five

	cleaning of equipment
		manual (counterproductive)
		CIP programs, however they have some environmental impact

	microorganisms love milk and dairy products
		pathogenic microorganisms make the produce unsaleable
		spoliage bacteria:
			pseudomonas spp.
		pathogenic bacteria:
			listeria monocytogenes
			salmonella app
		starter LAB during fermentation
			lactococcus
			streptococcus
		during maturation
			lactobacillus helveticus
			lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei
			lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis
			enterobacter faecium
			lactobacillus plantarum
	
	the transport of bulk milk from the dairy to the processing plant
		is critical
	
	storage and processing is critical too

	infestation problems:
		mites (infest the ripening rooms through the wooden boards)
			product weight loss
			waste of hte entire cheese
			they are in the wooden boards
			spread through the clothes of operators
		in the care areas:
			chlorine
			quaternary ammonium compound are used

	ozone:
		stronger oxidant compound than chlorine
		effective over a wider spectrum of microorganisms
		possible by-products:
			aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids
			do not pose a threat to human health
		reduce microorganisms, limiting the production of enzymes
		affected:
			temperature
			ph
			humility
			amount of organic matter around the cells
		against:
			spoliage microflora
			parasites
			insects
			molds
			mites

2. OZONE (O3)
GENERALITIES, PROPERTIES, LEGISLATION
==============================================

ozone chemical properties:
	[see text]

ozone solubility in water:
	0-30 degree C
	solubility 13 times higher than oxigen
	solubility decreases as temperature increases (inverse)

in industrial practice, ozone generators are:
	corona (most used)
	electrochemical
	uv

3 methods are used for the determination of ozone: [see text]
	physical
	physical-chemical
	chemical
