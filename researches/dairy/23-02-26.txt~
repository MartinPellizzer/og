THE USE OF OZONE TECHNOLOGY: 
AN ECO-FRIENDLY METHOD FOR THE SANITATION OF THE DAIRY SUPPLY CHAIN
=======================



1. intro
-----------------------

global cheese market:
	2019: ?????? billion, 20.98 million tons
	2020: $72.26 billion, 21.69 million tons
	2021: $192.81 billion (estimated)
	2022: $211.02 billion (estimated) 
		compound annual growht rate (CAGR) of 9.4%
	2026: $289.57 billion (estimated) 
		compound annual growht rate (CAGR) of 8.2%

	top producers in 2021:
		europe: 10 million tons
		usa: 6 million tons
		germany: 2.461.334 tons
		france: 1.716.120 tons
		italy: 1.197.390 tons

	top producer in europe - germany:
		drinking milk: 19.3% of europe
		butter: 21.0% of europe
		cheese: 22.9% of europe
		acidified mild products: 23.7% of europe

	[see table 1. for top cheese producers]
		
problems in the dairy industry:
	huge costs
	economic losses
	excessive product waste
	
	disinfection of the premises and equipment:
		large amount of water 
		steam at high temperatures
		chlorine-based chemical
	
	ex. ultra-high-temperature (UHT)-processed milk:
		uses a lot of chemicals
			alkaline cleaners
				NaOH
				HNO3
		results?
			costs for the disposal of wastewater
				for the sanitizers used
				for the production residues
			dairy waste waters (DWW)
				contains hinge levels of mineral
				and organin compounds
				bad for the soil and water
			conventionally, they are purified with
				physical-chemical
				biological methods
			1-10 L of wastewater per liter of produced milk

	percentage of dairy wastewater:
		49% cheese
		19% drinking milk
		18% acidified milk
		13% butterfat
		germany, france, italy, poland, spain, netherlands 73% of DWW

	common practice for the sanitation of water
		chlorine gas (Cl2)
		chlorine dioxide (ClO2)
		hypochlorite (ClO-)
	
	ozone is a viable alternative

	legislation for quality of water for human consumption
		EU directive 2020/2184 of 21 December 2021
		replacing the old 98/83 directive

		the new directive is to monitor some by-products of chlorine
			chlorates
			haloacetic acids five

	cleaning of equipment
		manual (counterproductive)
		CIP programs, however they have some environmental impact

	microorganisms love milk and dairy products
		pathogenic microorganisms make the produce unsaleable
		spoliage bacteria:
			pseudomonas spp.
		pathogenic bacteria:
			listeria monocytogenes
			salmonella app
		starter LAB during fermentation
			lactococcus
			streptococcus
		during maturation
			lactobacillus helveticus
			lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei
			lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis
			enterobacter faecium
			lactobacillus plantarum
	
	the transport of bulk milk from the dairy to the processing plant
		is critical
	
	storage and processing is critical too

	infestation problems:
		mites (infest the ripening rooms through the wooden boards)
			product weight loss
			waste of hte entire cheese
			they are in the wooden boards
			spread through the clothes of operators
		in the care areas:
			chlorine
			quaternary ammonium compound are used

	ozone:
		stronger oxidant compound than chlorine
		effective over a wider spectrum of microorganisms
		possible by-products:
			aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids
			do not pose a threat to human health
		reduce microorganisms, limiting the production of enzymes
		affected:
			temperature
			ph
			humility
			amount of organic matter around the cells
		against:
			spoliage microflora
			parasites
			insects
			molds
			mites

2. OZONE (O3)
GENERALITIES, PROPERTIES, LEGISLATION
==============================================

ozone chemical properties:
	[see text]

ozone solubility in water:
	0-30 degree C
	solubility 13 times higher than oxigen
	solubility decreases as temperature increases (inverse)

in industrial practice, ozone generators are:
	corona (most used)
	electrochemical
	uv

3 methods are used for the determination of ozone: [see text]
	physical
	physical-chemical
	chemical

materials: [see text]



==============================================
3. OZONE IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY
==============================================

3.1 Microbiological: a critical control point to be monitored
----------------------------------------------

critical phases
	termization of milk
	pasteurization of milk
	syneresis
		influence the aw (water activity index)
		developing microorganisms
	salting phase
		change the microbial ecosystem
		from starter lactic acid bacteria SLAB
		to non-starter bacteria NSLAB
	stewing
		optimal environment with temperature and humidity
		to help microorganisms proliferation
	maturation
		NSLAB microorganisms can change product
			consistency 
			sensory properties
			shelf life
		for aged cheese
			presence of mites
		
common sanitization methods for systems, instruments and rooms
	water vapor at high temperature and pressure
	chemical products that are chlorine-based

	these are constly form an economic and environmental point of view
	wastewater is rich in organic mater
		difficult and expensive to dispose of
		representing an excellent growth medium for microflora

bacteria
	pseudomonas: spoliage bacteria bad odors, flavors, pigments
		[list of pseudomonas]
	listeria: form biofilms contaminating the finished products long term
	salmonella: from fresh and femented dairy products 
		adapting to an acid environment


3.2 ozone technology in daity farming
----------------------------------------------

animal husbandry
	sanitization of pipes that carry the milk
		from the fooms of miling ot collection tanks
		usually done with chemical and hot water
		it reduces costs and environmental impact

ozonized water to disingect animals, surfaces and tools

sanitization of the air in the stables:
	at low concentrations it eliminates bad odors
	and pathogens

bovine mastitis
	a problem that afflicts farms 
	causing important economic losses
		as many as 60% of treated mastitis heals without
		use of antibiotics (6-30 mg of ozone)


3.3 efficacy of ozone on the working surfaces and equipment
----------------------------------------------

hot water with chemical are usually used

guzel-seydim et al. [88] 
	on stainless-steel surfaces to remove milk residues
	ozone water at 10 c
	hot water at 40 c 
	chemical oxugen demand (COD) are reduced 84% with oxone
	against 51% hot water

greene et al. [89]
	ozonated deionized water against psychrophilic contamination
		pseudomonas fluorescens and alcaligenes faecalis
	on stainless steel
	10 min exposurewith o.5 ppm decreased microbial growth > 4 log 10
	stainless steel were incubated in UHT pasteurized mild 
		and inoculated with pure cultures of p.f. (atcc 949)
		and a.f (atcc 337)
	beware that ozone can be corrosive with metal surfaces

[90]
	ozone + uvc was studied
	sterilization of bacteria and fungi
		(e. coli, s. aureus, c. albicans, a. fumigatus)
	studied on different material surfaces
		(stainless steel, polymethyl methacrylate, copper, ...)

dosti et al. [91]
	fresh 24-h bacterial
	treated with ozone (o.6 ppm for 1 min and 10 min)
	chlorine (100 ppm for 2 min)
	heat (77 +- 1 c for 5 min)
	the bacteria biofilm on metal was reduced by ozone and chlorine
		they were equal
		ecxept for p. putida (ozone > chlorine)
