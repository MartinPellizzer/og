## US REGULATION

Ozone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the USA and has been employed successfully for applications including:
- surface decontamination to extend the shelf life of cheeses and fresh produce
- decontamination of packaging materials 
- disinfection of process water
- sanitisation of processing equipment
- sanitisation of food storage areas
- other

(Mahapatra et al. 2005).


Ozone is Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS) in the USA for disinfection of bottled water and as a sanitiser for process trains in bottled water plants (FDA 1995).

In 1997, ozone was affirmed as having GRAS status for direct contact with foods by an independent panel of experts, sponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) (Graham et al. 1997).

The FDA released a final ruling in June 2001, in response to an EPRI food additive petition, amending previous food additive regulations and granting regulatory approval of ozone as an antimicrobial agent for direct contact with foods (FDA 2001).

The amendment to the FDA’s food additive regulations (Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 173) allows the use of ozone when used as a gas or dissolved in water as an antimicrobial agent for food.

This federal ruling cleared the way for the potential use of ozone in the US food processing industry (Hampson 2001).

Ozone is also approved in the USA for use on all meat and poultry products by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA FSIS 2001) when applied in accordance with current industry standards of good manufacturing practice (21 CFR 173.368; FDA 2003).

Enforcement of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) is under the administrative jurisdiction of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The provisions of the FIFRA are written to regulate the use of chemicals that are applied as insecticides, fungicides and/or rodenticides. Under the FIFRA, ‘chemicals’ are defined as materials that are manufactured, packaged, transported, stored and applied. Becauseof the characteristics of ozone (an unstable gas that must be generated and used on site as it is needed), it cannot be packaged, stored or shipped from a manufacturing point miles away from its point of use. Therefore, neither ozone nor ultraviolet (UV) radiation can be regulated as a chemical under the FIFRA.

However, a provision was included in the FIFRA whereby manufacturers of ozone- and UV-generating machines are required to register these generators as ‘devices’ that are manufactured, sold and/or used in the USA. The intent of this FIFRA provision is to provide the EPA with a register of (ozone and UV) generator manufacturers. In exchange for registering their products and for agreeing not to make claims for products (ozone and UV) that are not supported by the technical literature, (ozone and UV) generator manufacturers are issued a special EPA Establishment Registration decal that must be mounted on each generator. The decal simply states that the manufacturer of the labelled (ozone or UV) generator has registered his/her manufacturing facility with the EPA. The fact that an ozone or UV generator carries an EPA Establishment Registration Label does not in any way denote approval of ozone by the EPA for any application. On the other hand, if an EPA inspector visits a food processing plant and find that an (ozone or UV) generating device does not carry an EPA Establishment Registration Label, that inspector has the authority to order the unlabeled device to be taken off line. Therefore, any food processor using ozone within the USA should ensure that whoever supplies their facility with ozone generation equipment has registered that product with the EPA as a device under the FIFRA.

Non-US manufacturers of ozone (or UV) generators supplying those devices inside the USA are subject to the device registration requirements of the FIFRA.

From the worker safety point of view, processors must also ensure that plant workers are not exposed to concentrations of ozone higher than: (1) 0.1 ppm by volume (0.2 mg/m3 NTP) on a time-weighted average over an 8 h/d basis and (2) 0.3 ppm by volume (0.6 mg/m3 NTP) as a limit for a maximum exposure time of 15 minutes, not to be exceeded more than four times daily, according to US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations (please see Chapter 14) (CFR 1997).

The definition of the product used to disinfect washwater depends on the type of product to be washed, and in some cases on the location where the disinfectant is used (IFPA 2001). In the USA, the washwater disinfectants used for fresh-cut produce are regulated by the FDA as secondary direct food additives, unless they have been affirmed to be GRAS. Where a raw agricultural commodity is washed in a food processing facility, such as a fresh-cut facility, both the EPA and the FDA have regulatory jurisdiction, and the disinfecting agents (except for ozone and UV radiation) must be registered as pesticides with the EPA.

These outbreaks led the FDA to issue hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) regulations for safe and sanitary processing of juice (FDA 2001). A primary performance standard is a minimum 5 log reduction of the pathogens of concern in the juice being processed (FDA 2001). The FDA’s approval of ozone as a direct food additive in 2001 triggered interest in ozone applications. A number of commercial fruit juice processors in the USA and Europe began employing ozone for pasteurisation, resulting in the issuance of industry guidelines. However, these guidelines (FDA 2004) highlight gaps in the literature with respect to the critical control parameters of ozone during microbial inactivation in liquid systems.

## Overview of European regulations

These advantages are generally overlooked by food processors, but the new environmental legislation emerging in Europe, especially IPPC Directive 96/61/EC, is driving changes in the food industry.

Within the EU, among several processing techniques employed in food processing only irradiation and ionisation have specific regulation and labelling rules which also vary within member states (national legislation for irradiation); for other techniques, including ozone, no specific legislation applies.

However, there are two general rules which also apply to ozone:

1. Labelling Directive (2000/13) Indication on the label of the specific treatment undergone by a product – if the absence of this indication would mislead the consumer.
2. Novel Food Regulation (258/97) Premarket authorisation for 'novel foods', including those which have undergone a novel treatment process.

The European Council of Ministers has now adopted a proposal which permits the treatment of natural mineral water, but not spring water, with ozone, provided that the treatment information is carried on the label. The use of ozone is now permitted ‘to separate unstable elements from natural mineral waters which will ensure that the composition of the water as regards its essential ingredients is not affected’. The unstable elements referred to include iron, manganese and sulfur compounds. An important side effect of this new European permission for mineral waters will be the disinfecting capacity of ozone treatment, which in many ways is superior to that of chlorine.

Before the Council vote, the European Union’s Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) handed down an opinion on the use of ozone to treat natural mineral waters. The opinion recognised that ozone treatment may lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts and recommended that producers should comply with several conditions to minimise side reactions. The SCF concluded that residual ozone and the concentration of undesirable byproducts (bromate and bromoform) should be undetectable by the best available analytical methodology.

### Regulations in France
In 2003 and 2004, the French Food Safety Agency rendered two Opinions as to the safety of the use of ozone as an auxiliary technology to treat wheat grains before grinding. The first (AFSSA 2003) stated that ‘an ozone dose of 12 g (at standard temperature and pressure) per kg of grain, intended for the preparation of flour for pastries containing simple sugars added to a level of 7 to 50% of dry weight, does not present any health risk to the consumer’. The second Opinion (AFSSA 2004) extended the use of ozone from wheat grain treatment before grinding to ‘the preparation of flour destined for bread and baked products containing up to 7% of added sugars at a concentration of 8 g ozone per kg of grain at standard temperature and pressure, exclusive of traditional French bread’, which it described as posing no health risk to the consumer.

Hammond (2004) outlined the situation in Europe and discussed possible changes in regulations that may be introduced for fresh produce washing. The European Council Directive (89/107/EEC) on food additives lists the substances which legally may be added to food if they perform a useful purpose, are safe and do not mislead the consumer. The detailed controls made under the Framework Directive are implemented into the national law of each EU member state and stipulate which food additives are permitted for use, the specific purity criteria and the conditions of use, including maximum levels for specific additives; however, ozone currently is not on this list. There are opportunities to use other substances for produce decontamination, providing that they function as ‘processing aids’, which are defined as: ‘any substance not consumed as a food itself, intentionally used in the processing of raw materials, foods or their ingredients to fulfil a certain technological purpose during treatment and processing and which may result in the unintentional but technically unavoidable presence of residues of the substance or its derivatives in the final product, provided that these residues do not present any health risk and do not have any technological effect on the finished product’. Chlorine and chlorine dioxide, which are used for fruit and vegetable washing, are regarded as ‘processing aids’. Thus, they would appear to be outside the scope of the biocide controls as they are ‘defined’ in Directive 89/107/EEC.

Whether a washwater chemical is an additive or processing aid is of significance, since it is unlikely that a ‘natural’ agricultural product (such as leafy salad) which carries the name of a chemical additive on the label will appeal to consumers. Therefore, in practice, washwater decontaminants must be able to be classed as processing aids, which requires they have no lasting technological effect on the produce, a key challenge for the chemical sciences (RSC 2009).

The European Commission is planning to develop more detailed regulations governing the use of processing aids. Although it is at a very early stage of development, one possibility being considered is that the definition of a processing aid will be tightened, so that residues of processing aids in a final food will no longer be acceptable, unless the substance in question is specifically authorised for food use. Legislation on processing aids is not yet harmonised at the European Community level, and so processing aids that may be used legally in the UK and France might not be permitted in other member states. A global approach to processing aids is needed to control the agents which are essential for the minimisation of the potential transmission of pathogens from water sources to produce. The risk from pathogens is not eliminated by using large quantities of water; the risk of pathogen cross-contamination is only avoided by using processing aids.
