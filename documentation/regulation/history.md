- 1839 Discovery of ozone by Sch√∂nbein.
- 1886 The potential of ozone to disinfect polluted water recognised in Europe.
- 1891 Test results from Germany show that ozone is effective against bacteria.
- 1893 First full-scale application using ozone for drinking water in the Netherlands.
- 1895 The molecular formula of ozone determined by Soret.
- 1906 France commissions its first municipal ozone plant for drinking water.
- 1909 Ozone employed for preservation of meat in Germany.
- 1914 Research leads to the production of inexpensive chlorine gas and interest in ozone for water treatment begins to decline.
- 1936 Ozone used to depurate shellfish in France.
- 1939 Ozone found to prevent the growth of yeast and mould during the storage of fruits.
- 1942 Ozone used in egg-storage rooms and in cheese-storage facilities in the USA.
- 1957 Ozone implemented for oxidation of iron and manganese in German drinking water.
- 1964 Spontaneous flocculation in ozone contact chambers leads to France constructing an ozone plant to enhance particulate removal.
- 1965 Ozone employed for colour control of surface water in Ireland and the UK. Ozone used
to oxidize micropollutants such as phenolic compounds and several pesticides in Switzerland.
- 1970 Ozone exploited for algae control in France.
- 1982 US FDA grants GRAS (generally recognised as safe) status for ozone disinfection of bottled water.
- 1987 600 MGD (million gallons per day) ozonation plant comes on line in Los Angeles after seven years of pilot testing.
- 1995 FDA GRAS approval for ozone disinfection of bottled water renewed.
- 1997 Expert Panel convened by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) affirms ozone
as GRAS for direct contact with foods. FDA does not object to this GRAS affirmation.
Regulators have the option to later add controls on ozone use.
- 1999 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) rejects an ozone protocol for meat
application, citing the 1982 GRAS declaration for disinfection of bottled water in which
the FDA stated 'any other use must be regulated by a Food Additive Petition'.
- 2000 A Food Additive Petition (FAP) filed by the EPRI requests FDA approval of ozone for direct contact with foods.
- 2001 FDA approves ozone as a secondary direct food additive, antimicrobial agent (Federal
Register, Vol. 66, no. 123, June 26). The American Meat Institute files a letter with the US FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service of the FDA) asking for an interpretation on the scope of FDA rule. In its response, FSIS determines that, 'The use of ozone on meat and poultry products, including treatment of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products just prior to packaging, is acceptable', and that there are 'no labelling issues in regard to treated product'.
- 2004 FDA issues industrial guidance and recommendations to processors of apple juice or cider on the use of ozone for pathogen reduction purposes.


Several incidents of foodborne disease have been associated with juices. In 1991, an outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections and haemolytic uremic syndrome was linked to traditionally pressed apple cider. In the USA 21 juice-associated outbreaks were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1995 and 2005 (Vojdani et al. 2008). E. coli O157:H7 is an enteric pathogen with a low infectious dose, which usually causes hemorrhagic colitis but also has the potential to cause haemolytic uremic syndrome in young children and the immunocompromised (Boyce et al. 1995).
