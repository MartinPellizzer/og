Inactivation kinetics of poliovirus type 1 in ozone demand-free water was
investigated by utilizing a fast-flow mixing apparatus. Ozonated water and a
solution ofozone demand-free water containing a known quantity ofpoliovirus
type 1wereintroducedsimultaneouslyintoamixingchamber,bothataconstant
rate. This mixture wasthenpassed through a narrow tube ofknown length and
diameterintoaneutralizing solution. Byalteringtherateofintroductionand/or
tube length, different contact periods between ozone and virus could be deter-
mined with an accuracy of0.01 s. Inactivation ofthe poliovirus occurred in two
steps.Duringthefirststep,whichlastedfor0.2to 1.0s,95to99%oftheviruswas
inactivated, dependingonthe ozoneconcentration (whichrangedfrom0.1 to 2.0
mg/liter). The second step apparently continued for several minutes; in this
period the remainder of the virus was inactivated. An obvious dose-response
relationshipwasdemonstratedduringthefirststepoftheinactivationcurve.The
pH of the water slightly affected the viral inactivation rate, but these small
differencesseemtohave nopracticalvalue.
