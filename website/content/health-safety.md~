# intro

- ozone is a very strong disinfectant and xodising agent
- can change the chemical structures of food molecules, creating byproducts
- leverls of some nutrients in foods (vitamins, proteins, lipids) can be changed (usualy lowered)
- safety for plant workers, equipment and instrumentation
- equipment must be compatible wiht ozone, must not be converted into other materials
	- damage processing wquipment
	- contaminate foods being processed
- ozone is a gas that is partially water-soluble and unstable (short half-life)
- approved by fda as an antimicrobal food aditive
- ozone is instable, so it can't be purchased in containers, shipped and stored onsite
- produced onsite and used immediately
- excess ozone is then destryedd by converting it to oxigen, which was it's original form
- partially soluble, so it can degas and workers may breathe it
- avoid worker exposures to ozone during processing

# points of application of ozone during food processing

- ozone can be used in a great number of places

## aqueous phase ozone applications

- process plant influent water and product water (juice)
- spray washing of incoming food prior processing
- process water (reuse or prior discharge)
- sanitizing plant equipment (cip, clean in place)
- spray sanitation of floors and drains
- food contact and non-food contact surfaces (surface sanitation)
- food transportation trucks for spray washing of empty food containers and truck interiors
- reduce levels of microorganisms, destroy odours, colours and flavors and prevent odor transfers between food during shipments
- ice-making machine, to maintain the ice and chamber slime-free
- no ozone must escape machines and come in contact with humans

### potential health and safety issues with aqueous ozone applications

- some ozone in gaseous form can escape equipment or water
- ozone degas from water due to agitation, nozzle and poor mixing

## gas phase ozone applications

- storage of foods arriving at the plant prior processing
- storage of processed foods prior shipment from the plant
- food fransportation trucks, minimize the growht of microorganisms,control food odours and destoy ethylene (ripening of some foods) which speed up the ripening process
** - in some european food processing  plants, gaseous ozone is also used to disingect plastic packaging wrrap ads it is unwound just before suttoing a food ite or a food contraing.
** - is sometimes included in a modified air packaging (MAP) to extend microbiologicla reduction benefits of ozone during transportation of sorage of packaged food items
- package processed food items usingMAP wiht more than 21% of oxigen. using uv-185nm radiation some oxygen inside the package converts to ozone from the inside.

# health and safety issues with ozone for food plant workers

## ozone exporure regulations

- as with all strong oxidising agents, ozone is potentially harmful if humans are exposed to sufficient concentrations for sufficient time durations.
- in the usa, ozone in commercial/industrial work places is regulated by the Occupational Sagfety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the us department of labor

tab -- 

-- USA --

expected to be fatal 50 (30)

-----------------------
OSHA ozone regulations
-----------------------

- current permissible exposure limit (PEL) to ozone allowed by OSHA regulations is 0.1ppm for an 8-hour work day, 5 days a week
- olfactory senses of an average human being can detect ozone gas at levels as low as 0.01 ppm (0.02 mg/m3)
- OSHA also has a short-term exposure limit (stel) to ozone of 0.3ppm (o.6mg/m3), defined as a 15-minute exposure to ozone not more than 4 times per day
- suggested personal exposure effect and limits for exposure to gaseous oxone compiled by the compressed gas association (2001) are listed in table 15.1 
- similar data compiled by the workers compensation board of british columbia (1991) for exposure to gaseous ozone in canada are listed in table 15.2

-----------------------
uniform fire code regulation of ozone
-----------------------

- ozone has inherently less hazardous properties than oxigen 
- still, minimum sagety practices sould be implemented to prevent excessive human exposures
- uinform fire code (ufc) (1994)
- regulations to the transportation, storage, handling and use of other compressed gases (such as chlorine gas) are regulated ...
- ozone doesn't follow the same regulation because is never greater than 0.5lb stored on-site at any one time
- with oxone under pressure in a pipeline, there is a lways the potential for a leak to occure
- in most food processing plants, ozone is applied under partial vacuum (using and eductor or injector contactor)
- installation of aambient air ozone monitors
- flash alarm lights, sound and alasrm start up exaust fans
- limit 0.1ppm
- ozone-destruction units
- [operational - read book]
- all materials that come into contact with ozone gas must be completely ozone-compatibe to prevent ozone leaks
- 304 stainless steel, pvc, glass, hypalon teflon, kel-f
- the prssurised ozone safety concerns become moot with smaller systems sedigned to apply and carry ozone under partial vacuum, such as those that are used in food processing plants.

-----------------------
potential fire hazard from high-putiry oxigen use
-----------------------
- for economical and efficay reasons, is good to feed oxygen enriched air (up to 95% oxygen) than dry air
- contrary, oxygen higher than 21% can increase the chance of burning nonflammagle materials
- potential for fires for paper, cloth, wood, rubbers
- if ozone under pressure, also oxygen can leak
- if ozone used, is adviced to not be use carbon filters to convert any out-gassesd ozone into oxygen before release into the environment.
- oxygen + activated carbon = kaboom
- use terma/catalytic ozone destruvt system instead
- ufc 1994 give some recommendation of procedures and materials

-----------------------
safety history of ozone in commercial/industrial applications
-----------------------
- ozone used commercially for drinking water since 1906
- used ozone contiunually for the treatment of its drinking water for over 100 years
- most recent new-construction industrial plants use high-putiry oxygen to generetae ozne without experiencing hazards
- grams per hours to tons per day in some plants
- pulp bleaching, kaolin bleaching, wastewater treatment and reuse, bottled water treatment, swimming pools, cooling towers, synthesis of nylon intermediates, air treatment, marine aquaria, aquaculture, food storage adn processing plants, wineries
- in the century that has passed since ozone was first installed in Nice, there has never been a reported deatch due to ozone exposure
- thantks to hte engineers that understood the toxicity of ozone quickly

-----------------------
avoiding worker exposure to ozone in food processing plants
-----------------------

--- general considerations ---
- important to understand where leaks may occur
- ozone may leak near the ozone generator, ozone contacting unit, pipes carrying ozone gas
- ozone can desensitise human olfactory senses during prolonged periods of time, the nose habituates itself
- the 15-minute stel limit of 0.3ppm is normally used as the alarm for ozone generator power shutdown
- feed gas glow continues in order to flush ozone from the pipes, with consideration of potential fire dangers if oxygen used

-----------------------
specific plant safety measures
-----------------------
- in most of the food prodessing plants currenty using ozone, the production rates are below ~1000g/hr
- a little over 2lbs/hr from oxigen enriched air
- and ozone is applied adn distrivuted in aqueous solution under partial vacuum

-----------------------
controlling off-gas ozone ar fresher than fresh fish processing/packageing plant
-----------------------
- applications include spray washing bulk fish containers, doorways, utensils, hoses, latex gloves, process machinery, workers shoes, floor drains, washing fish prior to and during processing, and conducting plant wash downs
- agitation of ozone-containing water solution can lead to significant ozone off-gassing

-----------------------
third party evuation of aqueous ozone spray wash equipment
-----------------------
ex.
- 10gal/min water spray with a 3.0-3.5ppm applied ozone dose
- to sanitise equipment, walls, floors, drains, tables, conveyors, containers, tanks and barrels
- the other designed for CIP and COP (clean-out-of-place)

-----------------------
third-party efficady testing
-----------------------
table 15.3
- trichophyton mentagrophytes 6
- samonella choleraesuis 6
- staphylococcus aureus 6
- pseudomonas aeruginosa 6
- campylobacter jejuni 4
- listeria monocytogenes 4
- aspergillus flavus 4
- brettanomyces bruxellensis 4
- excherichia coli 5

=======================
safety of foods processed with ozone
=======================
- diminishment of the level os cicroorganisms present on the surfaces of foods
- extends the shelf life of the specific foodstuff
- but ozone is oxidizing
- extended contact with ozone (at higher concentrations) increases the chances that the foodstuff itself will react with ozone, thereby changing the initial chemical nature of the food
- you must apply just enough ozone to attain the cicroorganism-lowering objective, while at the same time minimisng any unwanted oxidative decomposition of hte food itself cause by exposure to excessive amouts of ozone
- epri 1997 evaluated processing foods of all types with ozone


-----------------------
nutrient impacts of ozone contact with foods
-----------------------
- foods are processed to preserve and extend its shelf-life, to increase its digestibility, to improve its palability and texture, to prepare for serving, to remove inedible parts, to detroy anti-nutritional factors, to create new types of foods, to testroy toxins and eliminate microorganisms.
- concern is the sagety of the food
- most food presrvation techniques decrease the overall nutrient content of the food, a price to pay for safety
- balance between extent of preservation and safety of the food and the nutrient retention following processing
- 3 main causes of food spoliage:
	1. chemical changes
	2. enzymatic changes 
	3. microbiological spoliage (most important for ozone)
** - traditional food preservation methods:
	- thermal processing
	- alteration of ph
	- chemical preservatives
	- microwaves and ionizing radiation
	- removal of water
	- or a combination
- all of htese techiques will reduce, to a varied degree, the nutrient content of the preserved food
- ozone does not penetrate deeply into foods
- any negative impact on nutrient content caused by ozone is limited to nutrients on the surface of the food
- under properly controlled preservation conditions, ozone causes only minor losses of nutrient content, lower than some other processes

-----------------------
impacts of ozone processing of foods on vitamin contents
-----------------------
- most affected by oxidation by ozone:
	- vitamin c
	- vitamin b1 (thiamin)
	- folate
	- carotenoids
- usually, vitami c and b1 are used as indication when measuring the effect of food processing techiques
- if these compounds are retained to a higher degree, then it is assumed that others will as well
- japanese studies on the thiamin and riboflavin (vitamin b2, more stable to heat but less stable to light) retention in cereal and bakery products, peas, beans, and whole spices

- naito and nanba (1987) treated 24 diggerent kinds of foods (ceral grains, cereal grain powders, peas, beans, and whole spices) with 0.5 to 50 ppm ozone at 10c fo 1h.
- riboflavin proved to be very stable during treatment, over 90% retention of vitamin b2 in all food samples, even with treatments of 50ppm ozone.
- thiamin decompostion was detected in some food samples of flours and spices treated with 50ppm ozone
- losses amounted to up to 40% in products with high surgace areas, but minimal losses (10%) were seen in whole grain abd bean products

- naito et al. (1989) treated wheat flour with 0.5-50ppm ozone for 6 hours to control airborne microorganisms prior to the production of japanese noodles and found no change in riboflavin content
- the shelf-life of hte produce was substantially increased, although som thiamin content was lost

- henry et al. (1996) studied the degradation kinetics of hte caroenoids, B-carotent and lycopene in vitro after continuous flow of oxygenated or ozone-containing water.
- each carotenoid was adsorbed onto a solid surface and ultra-filtered water saturated with either oxygen or ozone was a stroger oxidant than oxygen
- approximately 90% of the colour of lycopene and c-carotent were lost after 1 and 7 hours with ozone and in 2 7 hours for oxygen
- lycopene (primary red pigment in tomatoes) is more sucetivle than is b-carotene

- kolodyaznaya and suponina (1975) studied torage of potatoes in ozone-containg enviromnet, there was a 1.2-fold higher content of vitamin c than in control sample
- this reflects the effect of ozone on metabolism in the potatoes, as total sugars als odevreased by 1.3-1.5fold with a 3-6% increase in starch content.
- ozone knows oxidizing effects on ethylene (a plant hormone that increases ripening) with an end result of slowing the ripening process (erdman 1997)

-----------------------
impacts of ozone processing of foods on protein contents
-----------------------
- extensive use of this oxidant will chemically destroy a variety of amino acids (tice and gomez-paylor 1986)
- lalecheur and glaze (1996) 
	- oxidation of serine in water produes a set of carbonyl and carboxylate containing byproduct that reflect both molecular ozone and hydorxyl free radical chemisties
	- oxidative decarboxylation and nitrate formation is the preferred route of reaction of serine with molecular ozone
	- while ammonia formation indicated bydroxyl free-redical chemistry
	- the reaction sequences of ozone with glycine, alanine and phenylalanine have been delineated but then progress of the reactions is the same as for chlorine

- hasei et al (1994)
	- used ozonolysis processing to prepare an ozonatedccasein
	- harsh treatment completely detroyed all aromatic amino acids, except for a few ofth e phenylalanine residues, and reduced the true digestibility of the casein

- naitoh (1992) 
	- evaluated the effects of high levels of ozone (110-120 ppm) on the ozonation of amino acids in aqueous solution and found that the most labile amin acids were tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine and methionine
	- the metabolic products produced during this process were not found to be mutagenic, whether or not the pure amino acids or mixtures of amino acids and glucose were ozonated

* erdman 1997
	- in all the studies above, extremely high levels of ozone were utilized
	- there is no evidence that exposure of foods to levels of ozone tpically suggested for food preservation will cause any destruction of amino acid residues or reduction of preotein quality

-----------------------
impacts of ozone processing of foods on lipid contents
-----------------------
naitoh 1989
	- treated cereal powders, peas, beans, pulse products, cereal grains (0.05 - 50ppm) ozone and found that up to 5ppm ozone, oxidation of lipids rarely occurred, while at higher ozone lovels (50 ppm and higher), considerable lipid oxidation was noted

goreman et al. (1995)
	- studied he effects of several types of disinfectingtreatments, including 0.5% ozone-containing water on tba TBA (thiobarbituric acid) content of beef following 29 das of storage at 4c

sheldon and brown (1986)
	- compared the use of ozonated poultry carcasses with chilled water carcasses and reported higher TBA numbers in some tissues with ozone but not with others
	- sensory panels could not detect differences between treatment of hte broiler meat

watanabe et al. (1994)
	- used oozone (0, 0.03, 0.1ppm) during cultivation of nameko mushrooms and found that the ozone treatment increased palmitoleic acid contents and decreased the linoleic acid and PUFA/SAT FA ratios (PUFA = PolyUnsaturated Fatty Acids; SAT FA = Saturated Fatty Acids)

rice et al. (1982)
	- ozone is knows to react rapidly with unsaturated organic compounds
	- it would not be a surprise to find that at higher leverls ov exposure to ozone, some oxidation of PUFA and increase in peroxidation of fat had occured

erdman (1997)
	- however, at usual levels of ozone treatment, no significant effects are expected to occur

-----------------------
toxicoloty aspects of ozone processing of foods
-----------------------
kasei et al (1993, 1994)
	- feeding of ozone-treated casein to rats
	- casein was dissolved in 8 M urea, and then 0.3% ozone in an oxygen stram was bubbled into the solution at the rate of 100 L/h for 20 hours
	- ozonated casein wa obtained after lyophilisation of the dialyzed solution
	- chemical analyses showed significant losses of cystine, methionine, tyrosine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and histidine
