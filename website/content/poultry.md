## 8.2.2 Surface decontamination of poultry

In addition to red meat, ozone has also been evaluated for poultry. While
poultry scientists have evaluated the efficacy of ozone for chill and
wastewater decontamination, this section will focus on poultry meat
surface decontamination. Like red meat, poultry offers a medium suitable
for pathogen colonisation and growth.

Yang and Chen (1979b) evaluated the effects of ozone on poultry meat
microflora. To prepare for treatment, broiler carcasses were divided into
thigh and breast pieces. Natural poultry microflora were incubated to
produce an inoculum. The inoculated poultry was washed with a bottle
dispenser with 3.88 mg/L ozone and a flow of 2050 mL/min for 20 minutes.
Ozone washing reduced microbial counts with refrigerated storage. The
authors estimated that ozone treatment extended poultry shelf life by
2.4 days. Furthermore, it appeared that ozone treatment of poultry was
most effective for reducing Gram-negative rods.

Sheldon and Brown (1986b) also studied the impact of ozone treatment
as a disinfectant for poultry carcasses. Using the carcass chill water as the delivery medium, carcasses chilled with ozonated water had lower
microbial counts than those chilled with conventional water. In another
study, Fabrizio et al. (2002) studied the impact of various antimicrobials, including ozone, on S. typhimurium levels on poultry. For this study, broiler carcasses were inoculated with S. typhimurium and subjected to antimicrobial treatments. Aqueous ozone (10 ppm) was effective at reducing S. typhimurium levels over 7 days of storage. Levels of S. typhimurium were only able to be detected after selective enrichment.

Evaluating ozone and other antimicrobials, Vadhanasin et al. (2004)
investigated the use of ozone as a critical control point to reduce the incidence of Salmonella on broiler carcasses. Ozone and hydrogen peroxide
were similarly effective at reducing Salmonella incidences, while peracetic acid was found to be more effective and chlorination was reported to be less effective than either ozone or hydrogen peroxide.

Nieto et al. (1984) studied the effect of ozone during refrigerated storage of poultry on several microorganisms. Chicken carcasses were stored under normal and ozone-rich atmospheres (40 mg/h) for 13 days at a temperature of 2 ± 1 °C and a relative humidity (RH) of 93 ± 2%. The authors reported that ozone not only inhibited the growth of surface flora but destroyed the pathogens responsible for toxic infection and food poisoning (Table 8.2), without any adverse effect on the sensory quality of the product.


## Efficacy of Ozone as a Disinfectant for Poultry Carcasses and Chill Water

B. W. SHELDON, A. L. BROWN
First published: March 1986

The effects of ozone on the quality of poultry chiller water and broiler carcasses were evaluated in a pilot plant size water recirculating poultry chiller. The microbial counts of ozone treated carcasses stored at 4.4°C were consistently lower than carcasses chilled under nonozonated conditions. Greater than 99% of all microorganisms washed from the carcasses were destroyed by the residual ozone in addition to significant reductions of one third in the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and a significant increase in light transmission (500 nm) of the treated process water. No significant carcass skin color losses, lipid oxidation, or off flavors resulted from ozone contact.

## EFFECTS OF OZONE TREATMENT ON MICROFLORA OF POULTRY MEAT1

P. P. W. YANG, T. C. CHEN
First published: April 1979

Opzone was produced using a Welsbach ozonator and measured by an iodometric titration method. Microbiological characteristics of ozone treated and air treated control samples were studied. Ozone treated broiler parts had consistently lower microbial counts than the control parts during the entire refrigerated observation period. Using log total microbial counts of 7.0 cm2 as a spoilage criterion, broiler parts treated with ozone had extended shelf-lives for 2.4 days. Ozone treated samples contained about 52.7% gram-positive cocci, while the air treated control samples had 39.6% gram-positive cocci. Air treated control samples had 22.4% gram-negative rods while the ozone treated samples had only 12.7% gram-negative rods. Studies using microflora from spoiled poultry meat have also demonstrated that ozone treatment preferentially destroyed gram-negative rod-type organisms.

## STABILITY OF OZONE AND ITS GERMICIDAL PROPERTIES ON POULTRY MEAT MICROORGANISMS IN LIQUID PHASE

P. P. W. YANG, T. C. CHEN
First published: March 1979

Ozone was produced using a Welsbach ozonator and measured by an iodometric titration method. The stability of ozone in water depended on water temperature, initial ozone concentration and length of holding time. In general, ozone was more stable in water at 2°C than in water at 25°C. Percentages of ozone retained after standing were similar for initial concentrations which ranged from 3.15 to 4.65 mg/L. The germicidal effects of ozone were affected by contact time, temperature, pH value and presence of inorganic and organic materials in the solution. Longer contact time, lower pH value and lower temperature resulted in greater bactericidal effect. The bactericidal effects of ozone were reduced in Ringer solution, 5% NaCl solution and in the presence of egg albumin in solution.

Ozone was evaluated as an alternative hatchery disinfectant to replace formaldehyde in the event that the Environmental Protection Agency regulates the use of formaldehyde under the Toxic Substances Control Act. Cultures of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Bacillus species previously isolated from poultry hatcheries and selected culture collections of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus species, and Aspergillus fumigatus were spread-plated on open petri plates and independently fumigated with ozone or formaldehyde in a prototype laboratory poultry setter. Ozone (1.52% to 1.65% by weight) resulted in bacterial reductions of >4 to 7 log10 and fungal reductions of >4 log10, whereas formaldehyde achieved reductions of >7 log10 and >5 log10, respectively, after 8 min of exposure to either disinfectant. Potential mutagenic effects were observed in ozonated E. coli colonies resulting in decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased catalase activity when compared with nonozonated control colonies. In this study ozone reduced microorganism counts but not as much as formaldehyde. Ozone may be used as a disinfectant against selected microorganisms, although further testing under actual hatchery conditions is needed before making recommendations to the industry.

## Application of Ozone with Physical Wastewater Treatments to Recondition Poultry Process Waters

CHANGY.H.SHELDONB.W.
Received 6 June 1988, Available online 11 December 2019, Version of Record 11 December 2019.

Several wastewater treatments, including direct ozonation and a combination of ozonation with either slow sand filtration, dissolved air flotation, or diatomaceous earth (DE) filtration, were tested for their ability to recondition broiler process waters. The quality of broiler prechiller overflow water was significantly improved with all wastewater treatments examined, surpassing the USDA’s recycling requirements in nearly all trials. A combination of screening, DE filtration, and ozonation yielded the highest quality water. With this treatment, significant reductions in chemical oxygen demand, total solids, and the total microbial load including coliform bacteria and salmonellae of 87, 65, and 99.9%, respectively, were detected in the reconditioned prechiller water. Percentage of light transmission at 500 nm (%T) of treated water increased to 97% of tap water and compared favorably with %T of potable water. This same water treatment was tested on final carcass rinse and neck chiller overflow waters. The quality of these treated waters was also significantly improved. It was concluded that poultry process waters could be effectively reconditioned for recycling by screening, DE filtration, and ozonation. Furthermore, wastewater organic loads discharged to wastewater treatment facilities can be effectively reduced through these reconditioning practices.

## Comparison of Ozone and Formaldehyde as Poultry Hatchery Disinfectants

WHISTLERP.E.SHELDONB.W.
Received 15 September 1988, Available online 11 December 2019, Version of Record 11 December 2019.

Ozone and formaldehyde were compared as poultry hatchery disinfectants in a poultry setter, and evaluated for effectiveness. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Proteus spp. were inoculated onto open petri plates and exposed to ozone or onto filter paper strips and exposed to ozone or formaldehyde in a poultry setter. Ozone (1.41 to 1.68% by weight) resulted in significant bacterial reductions of >4 log10 on the open plates and >3 log10 on filter paper strips, whereas formaldehyde (triple strength) resulted in >7 log10 reduction on filter paper strips. Ozone was similarly lethal to organisms on filter paper strips at 90% relative humidity (RH) and 13.9 C, and at 50% RH and 37.7 C. Although under the conditions of this study formaldehyde (triple strength) was more lethal than ozone, ozone killed >99.9% of the starting microbial populations. In the event that formaldehyde can no longer be used in the hatchery, an effective alternative may be ozone.

Received 25 March 2016, Revised 8 April 2016, Accepted 11 April 2016, Available online 22 April 2016, Version of Record 22 April 2016.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of gaseous ozone for the degradation of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and inactivation of indigenous microflora in poultry feed. Feed samples were treated with continuous stream of two different constant concentrations (2.8 and 5.3 mg/L) of ozone at room temperature up to 240 min. The initial AFB1 level in artificially contaminated feed samples, determined as 32.8 μg/kg, decreased by 74.3 and 86.4% after 240 min of exposure at 2.8 and 5.3 mg/L, respectively. At the both ozone concentrations, 240 min exposure was reduced the aerobic plate and yeast and mold counts below the detection limit (<10 CFU/g) with a reduction more than 3.2 and 2.7 log, respectively. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) assay indicated that no significant (P ≥ 0.05) increase occurred in the level of lipid oxidation in feed samples during 120 min ozonation at 2.8 mg/L. At the end of the 240 min of exposure at 2.8 and 5.3 mg/L, initial TBARS concentration, determined as 2.4 mg/kg, reached to 4.4 and 5.3 mg/kg with a significant (P < 0.05) increases, respectively. The results presented in this study suggested that significant (P < 0.05) reductions in the AFB1 level and microbial population can be achieved in poultry feed by ozonation with an acceptable changes in lipid oxidation.



## Ozone and Improvement of Quality and Shelf Life of Poultry Products

Jindal, Vineet, Waldroup, Amy L.
Available online 11 December 2019, Version of Record 11 December 2019.

Three experiments attempted to evaluate the efficacy of using ozone during immersion chilling for improving the microbial safety and extending the shelf life of broiler drumsticks. Pre-chill drumsticks were treated with ozone)0.44 to 0.54 ppm) or air during immersion chilling (45 min at 0 to 4°C) and then individually wrapped and stored at 1 to 3°C. Ozone reduced the levels of aerobic plate count, coliforms, and E. coli on broiler drumsticks by more than 1.11, 0.91, and 0.90 logs, respectively. Levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Gram-negative, and Gram-positive bacteria were reduced by 0.38, 1.11, and 1.14 logs in the third experiment. Ozonation extended the shelf life (product was considered spoiled at ≥log10 7.0 CFU/cm2) of broiler drumsticks for as much as two days. Microbial reductions noted in poultry chill water were even greater than those on the surface of drumsticks. Levels of bacteria declined by 1.35 to 2.82 logs (95.5 to 99.8%).

## Recycling of poultry chill water using ozone

Waldroup, Amy L., Hierholzer, Rob E.
Available online 11 December 2019, Version of Record 11 December 2019.

A study was conducted to determine whether ozone could be used to meet USDA requirements for recycling poultry chill water. The system as approved by USDA used an ozone dose rate of 7.0 to 11.7 ppm in a series for four 580-gallon tanks. Total contact time during ozonation was approximately 30 minutes. Reductions in excess of 99% were achieved for total aerobes, E. coli, and presumptive coliforms. After ozone treatment, light transmission ranged from 88 to 99% (540 nm) as compared to fresh water. USDA approval of the system was granted in early spring of 1991.

## Feeding influences the oxidative stability of poultry meat treated with ozone

Andrea Ianni,1 Lisa Grotta,1 and Giuseppe Martino1,*
Published online 2018 Oct 26

Objective
Ozone is considered a strong antimicrobial agent with numerous potential applications in the food industry. However, its high oxidizing potential can induce alterations in foods by acting on the unsaturated fatty acids. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ozonation on the oxidative stability of chicken breast meat obtained from animals subjected to different feeding strategies.

Methods
Samples were obtained from commercial hybrid chickens (ROSS 508), some of which were nourished with a feed enriched with fats of animal origin, while the lipid source was vegetal for the remaining birds. Samples of meat belonging to both groups were treated with ozone and then analysis was performed to evaluate alterations in physical properties, lipid content, fatty acid profile, and oxidation stability.

Results
Ozone induced a significant reduction in drip loss in meat samples obtained from animals nourished with vegetable fats; this nutritional strategy also produced meats leaner and richer in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, useful for the assessment of lipid oxidation, were higher in samples obtained from animals fed with vegetable fats with respect to diet based on the addition of animal fats.

Conclusion
The ozone treatment improved the physical parameters of meat samples obtained from animals fed with vegetable fats, however the same samples showed a higher lipid oxidation compared to what observed in the case of the dietary intake of animal fats, probably as a consequence of the marked increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids which are more susceptible to peroxidation.

To assure food safety in poultry meat the European Regulation does not authorize any decontamination treatment. Ozone
has a strong oxidizing nature that makes it a useful tool for the inactivation of microorganisms. Aim of this study was to evaluate
the effects of an experimental ozone gaseous treatment and production of the biogenic amines putrescine and cadaverine, as
freshness index, during the storage of chilled poultry carcasses. Amines were extracted with perchloric acid, derivative with dansyl
chloride, separated using a reversed- phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method, and detected by fluorescence.
The results showed a reduction of microbial contamination as effect of the experimental ozone treatment of carcasses. In simply
chilled poultry meat (Lot C control) a significant increases of putrescine and cadaverine at 15th days of storage. At 20t day higher
levels of putrescine (53,63 mg/kg) and cadaverine (175,20 mg/kg) occurred in Lot C than in treated poultry meat of Lot A. Ozone
decontamination resulted in lower levels of putrescine (32,37 mg/kg) and cadaverine (132,30 mg/kg), and in Lot A the shelf life was
6 days longer than in Lot C. If authorized, an ozone treatment during the storage of chilled poultry meat can induce a reduction
of microbial contamination. Putrescine and cadaverine levels appeared to be useful to control the effectiveness of the ozone
treatment on meat quality, and may be useful as quality index to highlight the loss of poultry meat freshness, before sensorial meat
changes during storage of chilled poultry meat.

The control of poultry farming beetles (Alphitobius diaperinus Panzer – Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) infestation
around the world is based exclusively on Pyrethroid Group (cypermethrin) insecticide application (during the
45 days of poultry breeding). Some studies report beetles population’s resistance, reinforcing the need of
alternative methods for beetles control. Ozone (O3) gas is considered a GRAS (generally recognized as safe)
gas. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of O3 gas treatment to eliminate beetles A. diaperinus
development both, at adult and larvae stages. The insects were treated with three O3 concentrations
(30/40/60ppm) and exposure times (48, 36 and 24 h). All treatments were effective against its larvae stage.
However, the most efficient (100%) treatment for adult beetles elimination was at 40 ppm, during 36 h of
exposure.There is a need for future research on O3 application in order to reduce the pesticides
application/exposure, especially from the Pyrethroid Group, wildly spread for pest control in the poultry
environments (roofs, floor, screens and/or curtains. 


## Inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Poultry Chiller Water Using Combined Ultraviolet Light, Pulsed Electric Field and Ozone Treatments

International Journal of Poultry Science 3 (11): 733-737, 2004

A laboratory study was conducted to assess the efficacy of using combination of ultraviolet light
(UV) irradiation, pulsed electric field (PEF), and ozone for inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in poultry
chiller water. The E. coli cells showed high resistance when ozone was used alone in the study. Only about
0.6 log reduction was obtained at the ozone dose of 1 mg/ml of sample after 30 s contact time. UV treatment
for 1 min at the intensities of 117 and 234 mW/cm resulted in 2 and 3.5 log reductions, respectively. When
2
the sample was treated with 200 pulses of electric field at 23 and 30 kV/cm, E. coli inactivation was 3.5 and
4.1 log, respectively. Combinations of ozone, UV and PEF yielded additional inactivation effect that was
essentially sum of the different inactivation levels obtained separately for the different hurdles. Inactivation
increased with increase in intensity of the treatments. For the treatment conditions studied, combined
treatment using UV and PEF resulted in higher inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 in poultry chiller water.

Poultry litter is used as soil amendment or organic fertilizer. While poultry litter is enriched with organic matter suitable for land, the presence of pathogens such as Salmonella in poultry litter is a concern. To investigate the effect of gaseous ozone on pathogen reductions in poultry litter, this study conducted a series of experiments that involved understanding of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 inactivation at various doses of Ozone (O3) in wet and dry poultry litter conditions. Previously, ozone treatment has been shown to disinfect the surface of foods and plant materials including fruits, juices, and wastewater, however, additional research are needed to better understand the impacts of ozone on treatment of soil amendments. Sanitizing methods capable of eliminating pathogens of soil amendments are crucial to mitigate disease outbreaks related with litter/manure-based fertilizers. In this study, a bench scale continuous ozone treatment system was designed to produce O3 gas, with a range O3 concentrations (7.15–132.46 mg·L−1), monitor ozone concentrations continuously, and control the ozone exposure time (15 to 90 mins) to understand the effectiveness of O3 in eliminating S. Typhimurium and E. coli O157:H7 in poultry litter. Results showed that 7.15 mg·L-1 did not reduce the counts of S. Typhimurium until exposure to O3 for 90 min. The O3 concentrations of 43.26 ~ 132.46 mg·L-1 exposure reduced the bacterial counts. Furthermore, the moisture content of poultry litter was found to be an influencing factor for pathogen reduction. The pathogen reduction rates were reduced when the moisture content was increased. At higher moisture content, high concentrations of O3 (132.46 mg·L-1) were needed for pathogen reductions. The moisture content of 30% or lower was found to be more effective for controlling pathogen levels in poultry litter. Our study demonstrates that gaseous O3 treatment could be used as an additional decontamination technique to ensure the certain degree of microbiological safety of poultry litter based soil amendment.


## Effect of ozone on bacterial flora in poultry during refrigerated storage

J.C Nieto, F Jiménez-Colmenero, Ma.C Peláez
Received 8 November 1983, Available online 14 February 2003.

The effect of ozone on the microbiological and sensory quality of poultry during refrigerated storage was studied. Ozone facilitates the oxidation of lipids, but no alterations were observed in the sensory characteristics of the meat. Ozone has a pronounced effect on the flora causing deterioration and hence prolongs the useful life of poultry in refrigerated storage. It was also observed to exert a powerful bactericidal effect on coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella.

## Ozone-Based Interventions To Improve the Microbiological Safety and Quality of Poultry Carcasses and Parts: A Review

MAY 15 2019

Poultry meat represents an important part of the U.S. economy and diet. However, it remains one of the food categories responsible for the most outbreak-associated foodborne illness cases. Therefore, the food safety and public health communities continue to examine appropriate antimicrobial interventions to reduce product contamination and the risk of foodborne disease. Ozone treatment has become an attractive microbial decontamination option for food products including poultry because of its antimicrobial properties and minimal effects on quality. The objective of this review is to summarize the current scientific literature on the application of ozone in chicken carcasses and parts. Fourteen primary research studies met the inclusion criteria. Ozone treatment achieved microbial population reductions of 0.2 to 0.94 log CFU/mL of rinsate, 0.08 to 1.28 log CFU/cm2, and 0.0 to 5.3 log CFU/g for specific target microbial populations. Among the factors that influenced treatment efficacy were ozone concentration, exposure time, and the microbial population of interest. Studies indicate that ozone treatment can be optimized to extend the shelf life of poultry products without a significant effect on physicochemical and sensory qualities, which makes it a potential suitable hurdle to improve food safety. Further research is required to better understand the effect of ozone on poultry-borne pathogens like Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. and to validate its application and scale-up in industrial settings. This review identifies important knowledge gaps that may guide future studies about this novel decontamination technology.

HIGHLIGHTS
Ozone treatment achieved microbial population reductions.

Gaseous ozone was most commonly used on poultry parts.

Carcasses were treated exclusively with aqueous ozone or ozonated water.

Ozone treatment can extend poultry product shelf life without significant quality effects.



## Application of Ozone for Enhancing the Microbiological Safety and Quality of Foods: A Review

Ozone (O3) is a strong antimicrobial agent with numerous potential applications in the food industry. High reactivity, penetrability, and spontaneous decomposition to a nontoxic product (i.e., O2) make ozone a viable disinfectant for ensuring the microbiological safety of food products. Ozone has been used for decades in many countries and recently, the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status of this gas has been reaffirmed in the United States. Ozone, in the gaseous or aqueous phases, is effective against the majority of microorganisms tested by numerous research groups. Relatively low concentrations of ozone and short contact time are sufficient to inactivate bacteria, molds, yeasts, parasites, and viruses. However, rates of inactivation are greater in ozone demand-free systems than when the medium contains oxidizable organic substances. Susceptibility of microorganisms to ozone also varies with the physiological state of the culture, pH of the medium, temperature, humidity, and presence of additives (e.g., acids, surfactants, and sugars). Ozone applications in the food industry are mostly related to decontamination of product surface and water treatment. Ozone has been used with mixed success to inactivate contaminant microflora on meat, poultry, eggs, fish, fruits, vegetables, and dry foods. The gas also is useful in detoxification and elimination of mycotoxins and pesticide residues from some agricultural products. Excessive use of ozone, however, may cause oxidation of some ingredients on food surface. This usually results in discoloration and deterioration of food flavor. Additional research is needed to elucidate the kinetics and mechanisms of microbial inactivation by ozone and to optimize its use in food applications.


## Aflatoxicosis in turkey poults is prevented by treatment of naturally contaminated corn with ozone generated by electrolysis

McKenzie, K.S., Kubena, L.F., Denvir, A.J., Rogers, T.D., Hitchens, G.D., Bailey, R.H., Harvey, R.B., Buckley, S.A., Phillips, T.D.

Previous studies have demonstrated that a novel source of ozone gas (O3) maybe used to chemically degrade numerous mycotoxins, including aflatoxin (AF) B1. Subsequent in vitro analyses demonstrated detoxification of AFB1, suggesting a potential method of remediate AF-contaminated grain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of electrochemically produced ozone to degrade AFB1 in naturally contaminated whole kernel corn and confirm detoxification in turkey poults. Corn was procured from the southern coastal areas of Texas and HPLC revealed 1,220 +/- 73.3 ppb AFB1. Control and contaminated corn were treated for 92 h with O3 at 200 mg/min in 30 kg batches; greater than 95% reduction of AFB1 in contaminated corn was achieved. One-day-old female turkey poults were fed 1) control corn, 2) control corn + O3, 3) AFB1 corn, or 4) AFB1 corn + O3 mixed in rations (46% by wt.) and consumed ad libitum for 3 wk. When compared with controls, turkeys fed AFB1 corn had reduced body weight gain and relative liver weight, whereas turkeys fed control corn + O3 or AFB1 corn + O3 did not differ from controls. Furthermore, alterations in the majority of relative organ weight, liver discoloration, serum enzyme activity, hematological parameters, and blood chemistry caused by AFB1 were eliminated (no difference from controls) by treatment with O3. These data demonstrate that treatment of contaminated corn with electrochemically produced O3 provided protection against AFB1 in young turkey poults. It is important to note that treatment of control corn with O3 did not alter the performance of the turkey poults.

## Bactericidal Activity, Eggshell Conductance, and Hatchability Effects of Ozone Versus Formaldehyde Disinfection

WHISTLER, P.E., SHELDON, B.W.
Received 15 September 1988, Available online 11 December 2019, Version of Record 11 December 2019.

Ozone and formaldehyde were evaluated as disinfectants in a prototype laboratory setter against microorganisms that are naturally present on fertile, freshly laid, broiler hatching eggs. Significantly lower microbial counts of over 2.5 log10 (P<.05) were observed for water-misted and ozonated (2.83% by weight) eggs or formaldehyde-fumigated (triple strength) eggs than for control and water-misted eggs. Eggshell conductance studies as measured by egg moisture losses in a desiccator showed no significant differences (P>.05) among untreated, water misted, ozonated (3.06% by weight) with water mist, or formaldehyde (triple strength)-fumigated eggs. Hatchability was significantly reduced (26.5 to 37.5%) following ozonation (3.03% ozone by weight, 2 h) in comparison with effects of no treatment or water misting. Misting with ozonation was equally as effective as formaldehyde fumigation in reducing microbial counts. However, ozone treatment at the concentrations tested significantly reduced hatchability when compared with results of either no treatment, water misting, or an average hatchability figure for formaldehyde fumigation. These findings indicate that ozone is a good disinfectant yet may adversely affect embryo development when given in the gaseous form.

## Control of Pathogenic Microorganisms and Turbidity in Poultry-Processing Chiller Water Using UV-Enhanced Ozonation

Michael E. Diaz,S. Edward Law &Joseph F. Frank
Pages 53-64 | Received 17 May 1999, Accepted 03 Aug 2000, Published online: 21 May 2007

UV-enhanced ozonation experiments on unscreened overflow chiller-water from a commercial poultry-processing plant successfully compared the oxidative and bactericidal effects of four treatments (viz., O2/O3, O2 /UV, ( O2/O3/UV, and O2 as the control). Optimal treatments provided greater than 99.9% control of pathogenic microorganisms. Results far exceeded the USDA-FSIS requirements of at least a 60% reduction of aerobic plate count (APC) bacteria including similar reductions in coliforms and E. coli, as well as the maintenance of light transmission at a value no less than 60% that of fresh water, consequently permitting 90% recirculation of the required 0.5 gal (1.9 L) overflow per carcass. Also an additional synergistic reduction (≥0.8 Log CFU/mL) in APC bacteria was documented for ozone acting in concert with UV photons as compared with the sum of the effects of O3 and UV acting in series. Economic analysis of operational and maintenance costs for this UV-enhanced ozonation system estimates annual savings of ∼$244000 in a 1/4-million bird per day plant achieving water savings of 426000 L/day (113000 gal/day).















# Ozone in Meat Processing

## 8.2.2 Surface decontamination of poultry

Oltre alla carne rossa, l'ozono è stato valutato anche per il pollame. Mentre
gli scienziati del pollame hanno valutato l'efficacia dell'ozono per il raffreddamento e
decontaminazione delle acque reflue, questa sezione si concentrerà sulla carne di pollame
decontaminazione superficiale. Come la carne rossa, il pollame offre un mezzo adatto
per la colonizzazione e la crescita dei patogeni.

Yang e Chen (1979b) hanno valutato gli effetti dell'ozono sulla carne di pollame
microflora. Per prepararsi al trattamento, le carcasse dei polli da carne sono state divise in
pezzi di cosce e petto. La microflora naturale del pollame è stata incubata
produrre un inoculo. Il pollame inoculato è stato lavato con una bottiglia
erogatore con 3,88 mg/L di ozono e un flusso di 2050 mL/min per 20 minuti.
Il lavaggio con ozono ha ridotto la conta microbica con lo stoccaggio refrigerato. Il
gli autori hanno stimato che il trattamento con ozono ha prolungato la durata di conservazione del pollame di
2,4 giorni. Inoltre, è emerso che il trattamento con ozono del pollame lo era
più efficace per ridurre i bastoncini Gram-negativi.

Anche Sheldon e Brown (1986b) hanno studiato l'impatto del trattamento con ozono
come disinfettante per carcasse di pollame. Usando l'acqua fredda della carcassa come mezzo di erogazione, le carcasse refrigerate con acqua ozonizzata avevano un valore inferiore
conte microbiche rispetto a quelle refrigerate con acqua convenzionale. In un altro
studio, Fabrizio et al. (2002) hanno studiato l'impatto di vari antimicrobici, compreso l'ozono, sui livelli di S. typhimurium nel pollame. Per questo studio, le carcasse di polli da carne sono state inoculate con S. typhimurium e sottoposte a trattamenti antimicrobici. L'ozono acquoso (10 ppm) è stato efficace nel ridurre i livelli di S. typhimurium in 7 giorni di conservazione. I livelli di S. typhimurium sono stati rilevati solo dopo l'arricchimento selettivo.

Valutando l'ozono e altri antimicrobici, Vadhanasin et al. (2004)
ha studiato l'uso dell'ozono come punto critico di controllo per ridurre l'incidenza di Salmonella sulle carcasse di polli da carne. Ozono e perossido di idrogeno
erano altrettanto efficaci nel ridurre l'incidenza di Salmonella, mentre l'acido peracetico si è rivelato più efficace e la clorazione è risultata meno efficace dell'ozono o del perossido di idrogeno.

Nietto et al. (1984) hanno studiato l'effetto dell'ozono durante la conservazione refrigerata del pollame su diversi microrganismi. Le carcasse di pollo sono state conservate in atmosfere normali e ricche di ozono (40 mg/h) per 13 giorni a una temperatura di 2 ± 1 °C e un'umidità relativa (RH) di 93 ± 2%. Gli autori hanno riferito che l'ozono non solo ha inibito la crescita della flora superficiale, ma ha distrutto i patogeni responsabili dell'infezione tossica e dell'intossicazione alimentare (Tabella 8.2), senza alcun effetto negativo sulla qualità sensoriale del prodotto.
