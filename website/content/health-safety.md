# intro

- ozone is a very strong disinfectant and xodising agent
- can change the chemical structures of food molecules, creating byproducts
- leverls of some nutrients in foods (vitamins, proteins, lipids) can be changed (usualy lowered)
- safety for plant workers, equipment and instrumentation
- equipment must be compatible wiht ozone, must not be converted into other materials
	- damage processing wquipment
	- contaminate foods being processed
- ozone is a gas that is partially water-soluble and unstable (short half-life)
- approved by fda as an antimicrobal food aditive
- ozone is instable, so it can't be purchased in containers, shipped and stored onsite
- produced onsite and used immediately
- excess ozone is then destryedd by converting it to oxigen, which was it's original form
- partially soluble, so it can degas and workers may breathe it
- avoid worker exposures to ozone during processing

# points of application of ozone during food processing

- ozone can be used in a great number of places

## aqueous phase ozone applications

- process plant influent water and product water (juice)
- spray washing of incoming food prior processing
- process water (reuse or prior discharge)
- sanitizing plant equipment (cip, clean in place)
- spray sanitation of floors and drains
- food contact and non-food contact surfaces (surface sanitation)
- food transportation trucks for spray washing of empty food containers and truck interiors
- reduce levels of microorganisms, destroy odours, colours and flavors and prevent odor transfers between food during shipments
- ice-making machine, to maintain the ice and chamber slime-free
- no ozone must escape machines and come in contact with humans

### potential health and safety issues with aqueous ozone applications

- some ozone in gaseous form can escape equipment or water
- ozone degas from water due to agitation, nozzle and poor mixing

## gas phase ozone applications

- storage of foods arriving at the plant prior processing
- storage of processed foods prior shipment from the plant
- food fransportation trucks, minimize the growht of microorganisms,control food odours and destoy ethylene (ripening of some foods) which speed up the ripening process
** - in some european food processing  plants, gaseous ozone is also used to disingect plastic packaging wrrap ads it is unwound just before suttoing a food ite or a food contraing.
** - is sometimes included in a modified air packaging (MAP) to extend microbiologicla reduction benefits of ozone during transportation of sorage of packaged food items
- package processed food items usingMAP wiht more than 21% of oxigen. using uv-185nm radiation some oxygen inside the package converts to ozone from the inside.

# health and safety issues with ozone for food plant workers

## ozone exporure regulations

- as with all strong oxidising agents, ozone is potentially harmful if humans are exposed to sufficient concentrations for sufficient time durations.
- in the usa, ozone in commercial/industrial work places is regulated by the Occupational Sagfety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the us department of labor
