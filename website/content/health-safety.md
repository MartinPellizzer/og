# intro

- ozone is a very strong disinfectant and xodising agent
- can change the chemical structures of food molecules, creating byproducts
- leverls of some nutrients in foods (vitamins, proteins, lipids) can be changed (usualy lowered)
- safety for plant workers, equipment and instrumentation
- equipment must be compatible wiht ozone, must not be converted into other materials
	- damage processing wquipment
	- contaminate foods being processed
- ozone is a gas that is partially water-soluble and unstable (short half-life)
- approved by fda as an antimicrobal food aditive
- ozone is instable, so it can't be purchased in containers, shipped and stored onsite
- produced onsite and used immediately
- excess ozone is then destryedd by converting it to oxigen, which was it's original form
- partially soluble, so it can degas and workers may breathe it
- avoid worker exposures to ozone during processing

# points of application of ozone during food processing

- ozone can be used in a great number of places

## aqueous phase ozone applications

- process plant influent water and product water (juice)
- spray washing of incoming food prior processing
- process water (reuse or prior discharge)
- sanitizing plant equipment (cip, clean in place)
- spray sanitation of floors and drains
- food contact and non-food contact surfaces (surface sanitation)
- food transportation trucks for spray washing of empty food containers and truck interiors
- reduce levels of microorganisms, destroy odours, colours and flavors and prevent odor transfers between food during shipments
- ice-making machine, to maintain the ice and chamber slime-free
- no ozone must escape machines and come in contact with humans

### potential health and safety issues with aqueous ozone applications

- some ozone in gaseous form can escape equipment or water
- ozone degas from water due to agitation, nozzle and poor mixing

## gas phase ozone applications

- storage of foods arriving at the plant prior processing
- storage of processed foods prior shipment from the plant
- food fransportation trucks, minimize the growht of microorganisms,control food odours and destoy ethylene (ripening of some foods) which speed up the ripening process
** - in some european food processing  plants, gaseous ozone is also used to disingect plastic packaging wrrap ads it is unwound just before suttoing a food ite or a food contraing.
** - is sometimes included in a modified air packaging (MAP) to extend microbiologicla reduction benefits of ozone during transportation of sorage of packaged food items
- package processed food items usingMAP wiht more than 21% of oxigen. using uv-185nm radiation some oxygen inside the package converts to ozone from the inside.

# health and safety issues with ozone for food plant workers

## ozone exporure regulations

- as with all strong oxidising agents, ozone is potentially harmful if humans are exposed to sufficient concentrations for sufficient time durations.
- in the usa, ozone in commercial/industrial work places is regulated by the Occupational Sagfety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the us department of labor

tab -- 

-- USA --
threshold odor detection, normal person					0.01-0.04ppm
maximum 8-hour average personal exposure limit				0.1
minor eye, nose and throat irritation; headache, shortness of breath	>0.1
breathing disorders, reduction in oxigen consumption, lung irritation, severe fatigue, chest pain, dry cough	0.5-1.0

-----------------------
OSHA ozone regulations
-----------------------

- current permissible exposure limit (PEL) to ozone allowed by OSHA regulations is 0.1ppm for an 8-hour work day, 5 days a week
- olfactory senses of an average human being can detect ozone gas at levels as low as 0.01 ppm (0.02 mg/m3)
- OSHA also has a short-term exposure limit (stel) to ozone of 0.3ppm (o.6mg/m3), defined as a 15-minute exposure to ozone not more than 4 times per day
- suggested personal exposure effect and limits for exposure to gaseous oxone compiled by the compressed gas association (2001) are listed in table 15.1 
- similar data compiled by the workers compensation board of british columbia (1991) for exposure to gaseous ozone in canada are listed in table 15.2

-----------------------
uniform fire code regulation of ozone
-----------------------

- ozone has inherently less hazardous properties than oxigen 
- still, minimum sagety practices sould be implemented to prevent excessive human exposures
- uinform fire code (ufc) (1994)
- regulations to the transportation, storage, handling and use of other compressed gases (such as chlorine gas) are regulated ...
- ozone doesn't follow the same regulation because is never greater than 0.5lb stored on-site at any one time
- with oxone under pressure in a pipeline, there is a lways the potential for a leak to occure
- in most food processing plants, ozone is applied under partial vacuum (using and eductor or injector contactor)
- installation of aambient air ozone monitors
- flash alarm lights, sound and alasrm start up exaust fans
- limit 0.1ppm
- ozone-destruction units
- [operational - read book]
- all materials that come into contact with ozone gas must be completely ozone-compatibe to prevent ozone leaks
- 304 stainless steel, pvc, glass, hypalon teflon, kel-f
- the prssurised ozone safety concerns become moot with smaller systems sedigned to apply and carry ozone under partial vacuum, such as those that are used in food processing plants.

-----------------------
potential fire hazard from high-putiry oxigen use
-----------------------
- for economical and efficay reasons, is good to feed oxygen enriched air (up to 95% oxygen) than dry air
- contrary, oxygen higher than 21% can increase the chance of burning nonflammagle materials
- potential for fires for paper, cloth, wood, rubbers
- if ozone under pressure, also oxygen can leak
- if ozone used, is adviced to not be use carbon filters to convert any out-gassesd ozone into oxygen before release into the environment.
- oxygen + activated carbon = kaboom
- use terma/catalytic ozone destruvt system instead
- ufc 1994 give some recommendation of procedures and materials

-----------------------
safety history of ozone in commercial/industrial applications
-----------------------
- ozone used commercially for drinking water since 1906
- used ozone contiunually for the treatment of its drinking water for over 100 years
- most recent new-construction industrial plants use high-putiry oxygen to generetae ozne without experiencing hazards
- grams per hours to tons per day in some plants
- pulp bleaching, kaolin bleaching, wastewater treatment and reuse, bottled water treatment, swimming pools, cooling towers, synthesis of nylon intermediates, air treatment, marine aquaria, aquaculture, food storage adn processing plants, wineries
- in the century that has passed since ozone was first installed in Nice, there has never been a reported deatch due to ozone exposure
- thantks to hte engineers that understood the toxicity of ozone quickly

-----------------------
avoiding worker exposure to ozone in food processing plants
-----------------------

--- general considerations ---
- important to understand where leaks may occur
- ozone may leak near the ozone generator, ozone contacting unit, pipes carrying ozone gas
- ozone can desensitise human olfactory senses during prolonged periods of time, the nose habituates itself
- the 15-minute stel limit of 0.3ppm is normally used as the alarm for ozone generator power shutdown
- feed gas glow continues in order to flush ozone from the pipes, with consideration of potential fire dangers if oxygen used
