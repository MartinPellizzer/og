Storage grains are susceptible to a number of insects, which cause
considerable damage to the stored grains and could potentially develop
resistance to the currently employed insecticides. Increasing environmental
problems and new legislation have tended to reduce the permitted pesticide
amounts or even prohibited their use. Ozone use in fumigation is an
alternative to chemicals in controlling insect development. The use of ozone
for the control of fungi and mycotoxins in grains is discussed in Chapter 6.
The potential of ozone for the degradation of pesticide residues found in
food is discussed in Chapter 13. The proposed mechanisms for degradation
of pesticides, including organophosphates and organochlorinated compounds,
are outlined. The efficacy of both gaseous and aqueous ozone for
degradation and the processing parameters governing the process are
reviewed. 

Despite significant scientific advances and the demonstrated industrial
potential of ozone in seafood, meat and decontamination of pesticide
residues in the food chain, there is a paucity of reported studies in this area
in general. Also, the potential for reduced processing costs through the use
of ozone technologies has not been widely disseminated. Awareness and
understanding of ozone applications for foods is key to improved uptake
of ozone technology by industry. Increased clarity of the regulatory status
of ozone for food applications would facilitate increased global adoption
by the food industry.

Ozone employed for colour control of surface water in Ireland and the UK. Ozone used
to oxidize micropollutants such as phenolic compounds and several pesticides in Switzerland.

The definition of the product used to disinfect washwater depends on the
type of product to be washed, and in some cases on the location where the
disinfectant is used (IFPA 2001). In the USA, the washwater disinfectants
used for fresh-cut produce are regulated by the FDA as secondary direct
food additives, unless they have been affirmed to be GRAS. Where a raw
agricultural commodity is washed in a food processing facility, such as a fresh-cut facility, both the EPA and the FDA have regulatory jurisdiction,
and the disinfecting agents (except for ozone and UV radiation) must be
registered as pesticides with the EPA.

Health Canada also has not objected to the use of ozone for the purpose
of sanitising water in general in food industry premises (without direct
food contact). Egg shell may be treated with ozonated water (up to 2 ppm)
for decontamination. Very weak concentrations of ozone, below 1 ppm,
may be used as a pesticide, against plant decay, in cold storage facilities for
fresh vegetables. Such applications of ozone are considered by the Pest
Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) of Health Canada. The Food
Packaging and Incidental Services Section responds to petitioners wishing
to obtain ‘no-objection opinions’ from Health Canada, which are issued for
application of ozone on food-contact surfaces and air in contact with food.
That section also enables certain concentrations of ozone as a means to
decontaminate the hands of food plant personnel.
The application of ozone to the water supply,

Owing to the selectiveness of molecular ozone, not all compounds in a
water solution are rapidly oxidised by it, and certainly not at the same
rates. Moreover, in addition to the fact that ozone has relatively low
solubility and stability in water, sometimes the water itself may contain
ozone-resistant compounds (Hoigné 1998), such as many pesticides and
chlorinated solvents. Therefore, as a result of both the high cost of ozone
production and the only partial oxidation of most organic compounds
present in water, the application of ozonation might not be feasible from an
economic point of view. One way of overcoming this problem is to
transform the ozone into very reactive OH radicals as quickly as possible,
in a procedure known as ‘advanced oxidation’. This term simply defines
an oxidation process that generates OH radicals in large quantities in order
to enhance the level of water treatment. These radicals can be initiated in
the water containing ozone by means of an activator, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or UV light, or in the absence of ozone, by hydrogen
peroxide and UV light. Then, due to the oxidisation processes, harmful
substances are decomposed to less harmful substances without the
formation of particulate matter (von Gunten 2003; Huang et al. 1993).

Ozone as a disinfecting agent has widespread application to assure safety
and quality. It has several advantages over conventional disinfectant agents
such as chlorine, chlorine dioxide, calcium hypochlorite, sodium chlorite,
peroxyacetic acid and sodium hypochlorite. Some of these agents are inefficient
against specific organisms. Table 5.1 shows the advantages and disadvantages
of several disinfectants used in the fruit and vegetable processing industries.
Ozone is preferred over most popular disinfectants, such as chlorine, because
of the relatively low inactivation rate of chlorine at concentrations limited by
regulation. The main purposes of ozone application at the postharvest stage of
fruit and vegetable processing are: inactivation of pathogenic and spoilage
microorganisms, and destruction of pesticide and chemical residues.

Washing of fruits and vegetables was also reported to degrade pesticide
residues. Wu et al. (2007) reported that rinsing at a dissolved ozone
concentration of 1.4 mg/L for 15 minutes effectively removes 27–34% of
residual pesticide from vegetables. However, higher degradation of
pesticides residues can be obtained with an increase in ozone concentration
(Ou-Yang et al. 2004; Ong et al. 1996). Inan et al. (2007) investigated the efficacy of ozone for the degradation of aflatoxin B1 in flaked and chopped
red peppers. They observed 80 and 93% degradation of aflatoxin B1 at an
ozone concentration of 33 and 66 mg/L for 60 minutes, respectively.

Storage grains are very susceptible to a number of insects, such as
Tribolium, Sithophilus and moths, which cause considerable damage and
which could potentially develop resistance to the currently used
insecticides. Nevertheless, increasing environmental problems and new
legislation in Europe and the USA, as well as in other countries, tend to
reduce the permitted pesticide amounts (Fleurat-Lessard 2004) or even
ban their use. Therefore, ozone that can be used in fumigation is an
interesting alternative to applied chemicals for the control of insect
development. However, few studies have been undertaken to precisely
study its efficiency.

A similar reduction of the aflatoxin B1 level in corn grains was
later reported by Prudente and King (2002) in less contaminated samples
(586.8 ± 50.0 ppb) using ozone treatment. Furthermore, other studies also
reported reduction of pesticides in grain following treatment with ozone
(Yvin et al. 2001; Pernot et al. 2007a).

Adsorption
Granular-activated carbon fi ltration
(fi xed bed) or powdered activated
carbon (requires fi ltration process)
Adsorption of pesticides and volatile organic compounds,
removal of taste and odours

Ozone can be used in three functional ways: as a biocide, as a classic oxidant
and as a pretreatment for improving subsequent treatment processes. As
discussed above, ozonation can be used in water treatment to achieve a
variety of treatment goals, including (Langlais et al. 1991):
(1) Disinfection.
(2) Oxidation of inorganic and organic pollutants:
(a) iron and manganese;
(b) taste and odour compounds;
(c) phenolic pollutants;
(d) pesticides.

Other applications of
ozone are in the elimination of mycotoxins and pesticide residues from
agricultural products. However, excessive use of ozone may induce oxidation
of ingredients residing on food surfaces, thereby causing discolouration
and deterioration of food flavour (Jin-Gab et al. 1999).

In the fruit and vegetable processing industries wastewater and solid
wastes are the main effluents. The wastewater is high in suspended solids,
sugars and starches and may contain varying amounts of residual
pesticides. The solid waste comprises organic materials including rinds,
seeds and skins from raw materials removed to mechanical processes. The
greatest part of solid waste not resold as animal feed is treated with
conventional biological or composting processes.


## Introduction

Modern agricultural production relies on the use of pesticides to improve the
quality, quantity and diversity of crop yields. Figure 13.1 shows world and
US amounts of pesticide active ingredients used by pesticide type in 2006 and
2007 (Grube et al. 2011). About 172 million pounds of pesticide were used in
California in 2007 (Schwarzenegger et al. 2008), while 1.2 million tons of
pesticide were consumed annually in China (Li 2006). Agricultural pesticides
include herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, nematocides and rodenticides
(Table 13.1).

Pesticides applied to agriculture may affect nontarget organisms
and contaminate soil and water bodies. An extra 318 million pounds of
herbicides were used due to the switch to gene-modified crops, since herbicide-
tolerant crops allow broad-spectrum herbicides to be used. Furthermore,
the increase in seed price and decrease in herbicide cost causes farmers to
consume more herbicides with less economic pinch (Benbrook 2009).

The type and quantity of pesticides in agriculture and aquaculture varies
according to country. Variation in use also determines the pesticide maximum
residual limits (MRLs) in international trade. Excessive application of pesticides
in agriculture is absorbed either by the plant roots or foliar parts and
incorporated into the plant tissues. These pesticides have a carryover effect
in the resulting food and food product (Furlani et al. 2011). Toxic residues
from pesticides can be found everywhere, including water systems, animal
tissue and even human breast milk (Polder et al. 2009; Colles et al. 2008

Chronic effects of pesticides are neurotoxicity, carcinogenesis, abnormal
reproduction and cell development, mostly in the early stages of life
(Burrows et al. 2002). The health implications of pesticide residues in food
and consumer demands for chemical-free and safe food have resulted in
the development of strategies to reduce pesticide residues from
agricultural commodities through effective and sustainable post-harvest
technologies. However, increasing food production in response to population
growth and food storage without the use of pesticides and chemical fertilisers are significant challenges. Consumer demand for safe food with
less chemical residues has led researchers to focus on greener approaches
to detoxification or a reduction of pesticide use to a level safe for human
consumption.

Ensuring food production with minimal residual pesticide levels is
paramount to consumer protection. A comprehensive review of food
processing with respect to pesticide residue dissipation was reported by
Kaushik et al. (2009). Washing of fruits and vegetables with or without
chlorine has been shown to lower pesticides residue (Kaushik et al. 2009;
Ong et al. 1996). Home preparation by washing with different concentrations
of acetic acid, sodium chloride and tap water, as well as refrigeration
and stir-frying for different times can remove a portion of residual pesticides
in vegetables (Zhang et al. 2007). This chapter outlines the application of
ozone for the degradation of pesticide residues found in food. The proposed
mechanisms for degradation of pesticides, including organophosphates
and organochlorinated compounds, are also discussed.


### Types of pesticides

Pesticides can be classified by target organism, chemical structure and
physical state, and as inorganic, synthetic or biological (Council on Scientific
Affairs 1997). Classification of pesticides is generally based on their
structure. Organophosphates, organochlorine compounds, carbamates and
pyrethroids (Table 13.2) are the most widely used (USEPA 2009).

### Fates of pesticides

Pesticides are released into the environment through runoff, leaching,
absorption, chemical degradation, microbial breakdown, photodegradation,
volatilisation, spray drift and agriculture crops (Nollet and Rathore
2009). Chemical degradation mechanisms of pesticides are well known, for
example hydrolysis, photolysis and oxidation (Castillo et al. 1997).
A research study showed that pesticides decompose more rapidly inside
plastic-covered greenhouses than inside glass greenhouses, since glass
screens out much of the ultraviolet (UV) light (Kleier 1994; Katagi 2004).
Similarly, pesticides on foliage are more easily broken down by sunlight
than when they are contained in the soil. However, most pesticides are
resistant to chemical and photochemical degradation under typical environmental
conditions (Nollet and Rathore 2009).

### Degradation processes of pesticides

Degradation of chemical pesticides requires biotic and abiotic processes.
Biotic processes include biodegradation and metabolism. Sorption and
degradation are the second most critical elements that determine the rate of
decay of pesticides in soils (Kah et al. 2007). However, most chemical pesticides
are nonbiodegradable, persist in the environment and bioaccumulate
in adipose tissues of living organisms. They are persistent, lipophilic and
hydrophobic, which makes it easy for them to accumulate in sediment and
biological tissues.

Commercially, nanofiltration (Chen et al. 2004), activated carbon filtration
(Foo and Hameed 2010), reverse osmosis (Bonné et al. 2000), distillation,
adsorption (Gupta et al. 2006; Tepuš et al. 2009), photocatalytic degradation
(Devipriya and Yesodharan 2005), photodegradation (Tanaka and Reddy
2009), ionising irradiation (Lepine 1991), gamma irradiation, biodenitrification
reactors (Aslan and Turkman 2006), electrolysis adsorption (Vlyssides
et al. 2005), microwaving (Salvador et al. 2002), electrochemical oxidation
(Arapoglou et al. 2003) and ozonation (Ikeura et al. 2011a; Wu et al. 2007c) are
all reported methods used to remove or reduce levels of pesticide residues.

### Ozonation of pesticides

Organic contaminant removal, including of pesticides, pharmaceuticals and
endocrine disruptors, is one of the major objectives in water treatment. The
effectiveness of the treatments commonly used in Spanish drinking water
plants to degrade 44 pesticides including alachlor, aldrin, ametryn, atrazine,
chlorfenvinfos, chlorpyrifos, p,p′-DDD, o,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDT, desethylatrazine,
3,4-dichloroaniline, 4,4′-dichlorobenzophenone, dicofol, dieldrin,
dimethoate, diuron, α-endosulphan, endosulphansulphate, endrin, α-HCH,
β-HCH, γ-HCH, δ-HCH, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide A, heptachlor
epoxide B, hexachlorobenzene, isodrin, 4-isopropylaniline, isoproturon,
metholachlor, methoxychlor, molinate, parathion methyl, parathion ethyl,
prometon, prometryn, propazone, simazine, terbuthylazine, terbutryn,
tetradifon and trifluralin systematically detected in the Ebro River Basin
was investigated by Ormad et al. (2008).
The results indicated that oxidation
removed 70% of the pesticides. Ozonation in combination with a subsequent
coagulation-flocculation-decantation did not improve the efficiency
of the processes; however, a combination of ozonation with an activatedcarbon
absorption process gave rise to 90% removal of the studied pesticides.
The authors concluded that oxidation was the most efficient method
among the techniques studied for degradation of the majority of the studied
pesticides.

A similar study financed by the European Commission and
reported by Maldonado et al. (2006) also indicated that complete pesticide
mineralisation is hard to accomplish, and that large amounts of the oxidant
are required to lower the organic content of the solutions. The possibility of
ozonation cannot be ruled out if partial degradation is the expected goal.

Different organic contaminants require different treatment approaches
with respect to ozonation. In municipal water treatment systems, progestogen
endocrine disruptors reacted far slower with ozone than phenolic
estrogens (Broséus et al. 2009). The same study also reported that ozone is
effective for removing trace organic contaminants from water, with ozone
doses typically applied in drinking water treatment; ozonation removed
over 80% of caffeine, pharmaceuticals and endocrine disruptors with a
“Ct” (concentration × exposure time) value of about 2 mg/min/L, with pesticides
the most recalcitrant compounds to oxidise. Ozone was also applied
for pesticide degradation in wastewater (Ballesteros Martín et al. 2011).


### Degradation mechanisms

#### Kinetics

Ozonation of organic compounds including pesticide residues occurs by
complex mechanisms involving mass transfer and a variety of possible
chemical reactions. These reactions may be direct reactions of ozone with the target compound or its intermediates and (indirect) radical reactions
between hydroxyl radicals (produced through ozone decomposition
catalysed mainly by the hydroxide ion (HO−) and organics (Mishchuk et al.
2008; Cullen et al. 2009). The rate constants of ozone with four groups of
pesticides (4 phenolic, 8 organonitrogen, 8 phenoxyalkylacetic and
4 heterocyclic N-pesticides) were determined at pH 7.5, ionic strength of
∼10−3 M, and 100 μM NaHCO3 (Hu et al. 2000). The rate constants were
found to vary widely according to the type and structure of the pesticides
(Yao and Haag 1991). Hu et al. (2000) observed that the highest rate constant
was 27 600 M/s and the lowest was 61.8 M/s.

The logarithm of the rate constants was found to increase linearly with
increase of the occupied molecular orbital (eHOMO) values, except for the
phenoxyalkylacetic group. The term eHOMO is used to estimate the kinetic
parameters of oxidation of organic compounds. When all examined pesticides
were included in the correlation analysis, the rate constants gave a
statistically unsatisfactory correlation with a coefficient of 0.92, but showed
a similar trend of increasing reactivity with increasing eHOMO values of
pesticides. The results of the correlation analysis suggested that the reactivity
of pesticides with ozone follows the frontier orbital theory and can be
estimated by eHOMO. Rate constants at 20 °C and pH 7 were determined to be
11.9, 0.004 and 191.6 M/s for organophosphorus pesticides chlorpyrifos,
chlorfenvinfos and diazinon, respectively (Acero et al. 2008). The degradation
kinetics of pesticides is influenced largely by pH of the medium and
temperature. Temperature and pH have significant effects on the reactivity
of ozone.

Different systems have been employed to study the degradation
mechanisms of pesticides through ozonation alone and/or coupled with
other oxidation methods such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), photo-fenton/
ozone (PhFO) and TiO2-photocatalysis/ozone (PhCO). PhFO- and PhCOcoupled
systems were used as advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for
the degradation of biorecalcitrant pesticides including alachlor, atrazine,
chlorfenvinfos, diuron, isoproturon and pentachlorophenol (Farré et al.
2005). These are considered Priority Hazardous Substances in the European
Commission Water Framework Directive. The degradation processes of the
different pesticides, which occurred through oxidation of the organic
molecules by generated HO° radicals, followed first- and zero-order kinetics
when PhFO and PhCO were applied, respectively. Javier-Benitez et al.
(2002) also reported that the degradation of carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-
dimethylbenzofuran-7-yl methylcarbamate, a priority pollutant) follows
pseudo-first-order kinetics with degradation under ozone, UV radiation
and Fenton’s reagent treatment.

Most laboratory investigations of pesticide degradation kinetics employ
ultrapure water and high-purity pesticide standards (e.g. Acero et al. 2008);
however, under field conditions the full story may be very different. The
presence of impurities or organic matter will compete with target pesticides and may greatly increase the running cost and duration for pesticide
degradation. Under certain cases, impurities in the system are beneficial
for degradation. Okawa et al. (2004) reported that degradation of
2,4- dichlorophenol by ozone in acetic acid was increased by 2.6 times with
the inclusion of humic substances (natural organic matter). A comprehensive
review paper on pesticide chemical oxidation has been summarised by
Chiron et al. (2000). The presence of a low concentration of surfactant could
improve the removal of atrazine by increasing the dissolution of ozone and
the indirect generation of hydroxyl free radicals (Chu et al. 2006).
Remediation time for trichloroethylene removal was reduced by more than
29% by applying acetic acid solutions saturated with ozone. However,
increasing the ozone concentration was the best method for reducing remediation
time, followed by increasing acetic acid concentration and
increasing flow rate (Alcantara-Garduño et al. 2008).

#### Intermediates and oxidation products

Pesticides are complex molecules, but their degradation intermediates can
be more toxic than their parental forms. In most cases, target pesticides
cannot be mineralised solely by ozone, but are transformed into intermediates,
and some of the products formed do not react further with ozone
(Gottschalk et al. 2000).

One of the health concerns of using oxidants to
degrade pesticides is the formation of toxic intermediates. The structures of
pesticides play an important role in byproduct toxicity; some degradation
intermediates can be more toxic than their parental forms, while ozone
byproducts of other pesticides may be less toxic. Oxidation products of
organophosphorus pesticides (diazinon, methyl-parathion, parathion,
chlorpyris) include oxons (such as diazinon oxon, methyl paraoxon, paraoxon,
chlorpyris-oxon), and picric acid, phosphoric acid and nitrophenol
were identified (Gunther et al. 1970; Laplanche et al. 1984; Pond et al. 1995;
Wu et al. 2009). The oxon forms of organophosphorus pesticides were more
potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors than the parental organophosphorus
pesticides (USEPA 2001). On the organism level, the degradation products
of isoproturon are also more toxic to Daphnia magna than the parent compound
(Mansour et al. 1999).

However, many studies suggested that most toxic intermediates can also
be detoxified by ozonation. Some studies indicated that byproducts formed
from the oxidation of organophosphorus pesticides and organochlorine
pesticides were less toxic than the parental pesticides, evaluated with gap
junction intercellular communication (GJIC) assay in vitro (Masten et al.
2001; Wu et al. 2007b). The oxidation intermediates of diazinon were found
to be relatively safe, with no bioaccumulation and toxicity in fish, and the
contamination of fish and other aquatic organisms by the oxidation products
of diazinon and other organophosphorus insecticides in the environment
was low (Tsuda et al. 1997). The catalytic ozonation of dichlorvos (DDVP) using microporous silicate can successfully decrease its effect on
total cytotoxicity (Fujita et al. 2002). Studies to date show that the pesticides
can be detoxified by ozonation, but it is important to apply an excessive
ozone dose and proper ozonation conditions so as to remove the potential
accumulation of oxons (Wu et al. 2009).

Ozone is capable of causing ring cleavage in aqueous solutions
(Turhan and Uzman 2008) for phenol removal. Removal of aniline was
studied by Pierpoint et al. (2003) by radioisotope-labelled pesticides
and soil columns exposed to 0.6% ozone gas (wt). The initial products
included nitrosobenzene and nitrobenzene, which were then oxidised to
CO2. Similarly, trifluralin was oxidised to 14CO2. Complete degradation
is possible after extended ozonation, such as removal of the pesticide
deltamethrin in an ozonation period of 210 minutes, as reported by
Lafi and Al-Qodah (2006). Also using radioactive labelling, 14CO2 production
contributed up to 20% in the degradation process of chlorophenylurea
pesticides (Amir Tahmasseb et al. 2002). There may be different
pathways for mineralisation and for production of different intermediates.
The degradation rate for chlorphenylurea pesticides was slower
by a factor of 2.5, giving rise to additional pathways of hydroxylation
of the phenyl ring and carbinolamine intermediate (Amir Tahmasseb
et al. 2002).

Gas chromatography/electron capture detection is commonly used to
determine degradation products, such as for organochlorine compounds
after ozone and ozone/H2O2 treatment (Ormad et al. 1997). Degradation
products only accounted for 70–80% of the initial concentration of
methyl pirimiphos after ozonation (Chiron et al. 1998). Inhibition of
bioluminescence from Vibrio fischeri appears to be one of the most versatile
indicators of toxic compounds generated in oxidative degradation
processes involving pesticides. However, detection of neurotoxic compounds,
which can be generated in AOPs of some organophosphorus
pesticides, requires acetylcholinesterase (AChE) bioassays that rely on
inhibiting AChE activity. Bavcon Kralj et al. (2007) reported successful
cases of the AChE flow- injection analysis (FIA)-thermal lens spectrometric
(TLS) bioassay for toxicity testing in degradation of organophosphates
by AOPs.

Chelme-Ayala et al. (2010) proposed a mechanism for the degradation
of bromoxynil pesticide in aqueous solution with ozone (Figure 13.2).
They suggested that bromoxynil may degrade via hydroxylation,
leading to the formation of 3,5-dibromo-2,4-dihydroxybenzonitrile, or
that debromination may proceed via 3-bromo-4,5-dihydroxybenzonitrile,
3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile, generating 4-hydroxybenzonitrile.
Reaction pathways and mechanisms of photodegradation of
pesticides were extensively reviewed by Burrows et al. (2002). They
concluded that photodegradation of most pesticides by direct sunlight
is minimal, which results in persistence of these pesticides in the
environment.

Mechanisms of photodegradation could involve the following (Burrows
et al. 2002):
(1) Direct photolysis leading to homolysis, heterolysis or photoionisation
of the pesticide.
(2) Photosensitised photodegradation due to the absorption of light by a
molecule.
(3) Photocatalytic degradation due to cyclic photoprocesses with the
regeneration of the catalyst until all the substrate is destroyed.
(4) Direct reaction with the hydroxyl radical (HO°).

### Ozone application for pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables

As oxidation is the major degradation process for common pesticides, it is
logical that application of common oxidants, including ozone, is expected
to be promising for the removal of pesticide residues. Ozonation may be a
safe and promising process for the removal of pesticides on fruit and
vegetable surfaces under domestic and industrial conditions.

The effectiveness
(50–100%) of ozonated and chlorinated water dips in the dissipation of
azinphos-methyle, captan and formetanate hydrochloride on fresh and
processed apples was reported by Ong et al. (1996).

It is of concern that
application of high levels of oxidants to foodstuffs may destroy some
nutritional elements. The feasibilities of using low levels of dissolved ozone (1.4–2.0 mg/L) for the removal of the four pesticide residues (diazinon,
methyl parathion, parathion, cypermethrin) on vegetable surfaces (Brassica
rapa) was confirmed by Wu et al. (2007b). Their study indicated that more
than 60% of cypermethrin and 27–55% of diazinon, methyl parathion and
parathion was removed from vegetables (Table 13.3). Rinsing at 1.4 mg/L
initial dissolved ozone for 15 minutes removed 27–34% of residual pesticide.
Rinsing at a higher concentration of initial dissolved ozone (2.0 mg/L)
increased the efficiency of pesticide removal to 30–54%. Extended rinsing
at 2.0 mg/L initial dissolved ozone for 30 minutes increased the pesticide
removal efficiency to 45–61%. In addition, the removal efficiency of
pesticides depended on the dissolved ozone levels and temperature.

Wu et al. (2007c) observed that at 14 °C, only 36.2, 24.8, 19.7 and 44.3% of
residual diazinon, methyl-parathion, parathion and cypermethrin,
respectively, remained in vegetables. However, at 24 °C with similar
dissolved ozone concentration (2 mg/L) the reduction efficiency of the same
respective pesticides increased to 53.4, 47.9, 55.3 and 61.1%, respectively, in
30 minutes. Similarly, Ong et al. (1996) observed that the rate of degradation
of the pesticides generally increased with increased pH and temperature.

Ong et al. (1996) observed that about 53% of azinphos-methyl pesticide
residue was removed with the water wash and 75% with ozone-containing
water (0.25 mg/L) compared to unwashed apples. Hwang et al. (2001) also
studied the effectiveness of various wash treatments (chlorine, chlorine
dioxide, hydrogen peroxyacetic acid and ozone) on the removal of the
mancozeb and ethylenethiourea (ETU) on and in fresh and processed
apples. They observed 56–97% decreases in mancozeb residue and complete
removal of ethylene-thiourea after ozone (3 ppm) washing.

In another study, Gabler et al. (2010) determined the effect of ozone
fumigation on the residues of fenhexamid, cyprodinil, pyrimethanil and
pyraclostrobin. They observed a significant reduction in the pesticide
residue levels due to ozone fumigation of about 68.5, 75.4, 83.7 and 100.0%,
respectively, after a single fumigation with 10 000 μl/L ozone for 1 hour.

However, they did not observe any significant effect on the residues of
iprodione and boscalid. Degradation of pesticide residues owning to ozone
is attributed to pesticide type. Both iprodione and boscalid, studied by
Gabler et al. (2010), have systemic activity and might have protection from
grape tissues. Iprodione is reported to degrade at a relatively slow rate
(Hu et al. 2000; Gabler et al. 2010).

Ikeura et al. (2011a) investigated the effectiveness of an ozone microbubble
(OMB) generator (Figure 13.3) for the removal of residual fenitrothion from lettuce, cherry tomatoes and strawberries. They observed that the
decompression type was more effective than the gas–water circulation type
in removing the residual pesticide in vegetables, which could be attributed
to the larger number of small OMBs that could more easily infiltrate into
vegetables than with the gas–water circulation type. Moreover, OMB
treatment solutions generate hydroxyl radicals that are highly effective at
decomposing organic molecules, including pesticide residues (Ikeura et al.
2011b; Sumikura et al. 2007; Takahashi et al. 2007). 

### Current status and opportunities

#### Ozone concentrations

As most residual pesticides found on fruit and vegetables are water-based,
cleansing by ozone-containing water has two primary benefits: oxidative
degradation, and conventional removal of soil and pesticides through
simple dissolution and physical removal. Different ozone-based systems
and gas/liquid phase combinations were compared by Tizaoui et al. (2008).

Their study determined the removal of a reactive dyestuff, orange RO16,
and 2-chlorophenol in relation to degradation performance and ozone
consumption. The systems investigated included (1) liquid/gas-ozone
(LGO): ozone was applied as it was produced in the gas phase; (2) liquid/
solid-ozone (LSO): ozone was adsorbed on particulate silica-based material
and then applied to water; (3) liquid/liquid-ozone (LLO): ozone was
dissolved in a water-immiscible solvent and then applied to water; and
(4) a photocatalytic system using a titanium dioxide catalyst (PHC).

The
reports indicated that the LSO system offered the possibility of using long
contact times for slow ozone reactions and that the LLO system is most
suitable for fast ozone reactions. However, both systems offer the prospect
of more efficient use of ozone by extracting specific pollutants away from
the water phase to the solid or solvent phases. Pflieger et al. (2009) also
reported that ozonolysis of alachlor, trifluralin and terbutylazine adsorbed
on silica particles under atmospheric conditions led to a long lifetime (more
than 8 months) under 40 ppb of ozone. For the above reasons, using ozone
gas for residual pesticide removal seems less promising.

In addition to pesticide removal, ozone has numerous applications in
the food supply chain. Ozone gas is promising for microbial control of
dried fruit, vegetables and crops: for example, microbial flora and degradation
of alfatoxin in dried figs (Zorlugenç et al. 2008) and date fruits
(Habibi Najafi and Haddad Khodaparast 2009), and insect pest control
(Tribolium spp.) (Sousa et al. 2008). Ozone can be applied under vacuum
for fresh-cut cantaloupe microbial control (Selma et al. 2008). However,
certain levels of residual pesticide removal could not be removed through
ozone fumigation.

Corona discharge for ozone generation is the most commonly employed
and technologically feasible method for ozone gas generation; other methods
are readily available but are generally expensive and are restricted for smallscale
and laboratory production. Although ozone-containing water can be
produced and directed by some alternative methods, mixing ozone with
water through a Venturi tube or nanobubbling is the main method of application
technology for production of ozone-containing water. Dissolved ozone
levels are unlikely to exceed 1.0 mg/L by Venturi injection if ozone is produced
by passing dried ambient air (oxygen content 20.9%) through a corona
discharge device for ozone production. In principle, passing higher-purity
oxygen (e.g. >90%, from an oxygen cylinder or molecular sieve concentrator)
can produce an oxygen-enriched air stream with higher ozone concentration.
If it is passed to a Venturi tube for ozone-containing water production, a
higher level of dissolved ozone of about 5–10 mg/L can be achieved.

Since water with ozone micro- or nanobubbles has a dual function – water
washing and direct ozone gas oxidation – micro- or nanobubble ozone generators
are readily available in the market. The standardised indigo blue
method is less feasible for dissolved ozone determination for water with
fine bubbles, as the bubbles greatly affect the light path for colourimetric
determination. Less-contaminated surface water has an oxidation reduction
potential (ORP) level of around 200 mV. Higher ORP levels, such as 500 mV,
can instantly kill many common microbes. It is also expected that it can
remove a great portion of residual pesticides on fruits and vegetables.

### Physical nature of plants affects degradation efficacy

As discussed above, degradation of pesticides by ozone must allow it to
come into contact with the target pesticide. This physical phenomenon
makes it less feasible for pesticide removal on fruit and vegetables with
rough and hairy surfaces during ozone washing. However, inclusion of
agitation may enhance penetration of ozone for effective disinfection.

### Future trends

Advances in electronics will make ozone production simpler and more
affordable (an ozone device powered by a 1.5 V battery is readily available
on the market). These advances, combined with the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval for use of ozone as an antimicrobial agent
for direct contact with foods, will ensure that ozonation becomes a safe and
promising process for the removal of pesticides from fruit and vegetable
surfaces under commercial and domestic conditions. In an era of high
energy demand, global concerns for energy conservation and enhanced
environmentally friendly technology, ozone is set to become a more favourable
option for pesticide removal; Tizaoui et al. (2008) estimated that a
photocatalytic system using titanium dioxide catalyst showed the lowest rates and highest energy consumption by a factor of up to 400 times as
compared to other ozone-based systems. Further research and development
on ozonation technology should focus on:

the development of improved devices for ozone gas production, to be
employed for the production of ozone-containing water;
● investigating the feasibility of direct production of ozone-containing
water without prior production of ozone gas;
● producing a higher purity of ozone gas without generation of other
gaseous (e.g. nitrogen oxides) or soluble byproducts (e.g. nitrates).





































Il potenziale dell'ozono per la degradazione dei residui di pesticidi trovati in il cibo è discusso nel capitolo 13. I meccanismi proposti per il degrado di pesticidi, inclusi organofosfati e composti organoclorurati,
sono delineati.

Ozono utilizzato per ossidare microinquinanti come composti fenolici e diversi pesticidi in Svizzera.

Concentrazioni molto deboli di ozono, inferiori a 1 ppm,
può essere utilizzato come antiparassitario, contro la decomposizione delle piante, nelle celle frigorifere per
verdure fresche. Tali applicazioni di ozono sono considerate dal Pest
Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) di Health Canada.

a volte l'acqua stessa può contenere
composti resistenti all'ozono (Hoigné 1998), come molti pesticidi e
solventi clorurati. 

Gli scopi principali dell'applicazione dell'ozono nella fase post-raccolta di
lavorazione di frutta e verdura sono: inattivazione di agenti patogeni e deterioramento
microrganismi e distruzione di pesticidi e residui chimici.

È stato anche segnalato che il lavaggio di frutta e verdura degrada i pesticidi
residui. Wu et al. (2007) hanno riportato che il risciacquo ad ozono disciolto
concentrazione di 1,4 mg/L per 15 minuti rimuove efficacemente il 27-34% di
residui di pesticidi dalle verdure.

Ou-Yang et al. 2004; Ong et al. 1996). Inan et al. (2007) hanno studiato l'efficacia dell'ozono per la degradazione dell'aflatossina B1 in scaglie e sminuzzate
peperoni rossi. Hanno osservato una degradazione dell'80 e del 93% dell'aflatossina B1 ad an
concentrazione di ozono rispettivamente di 33 e 66 mg/L per 60 minuti.

Pertanto, l'ozono che può essere utilizzato nella fumigazione è un
interessante alternativa ai prodotti chimici applicati per il controllo degli insetti
sviluppo. Tuttavia, pochi studi sono stati intrapresi con precisione
studiarne l'efficienza.

Si è verificata una riduzione simile del livello di aflatossina B1 nei chicchi di mais
successivamente riportato da Prudente e King (2002) in campioni meno contaminati
(586,8 ± 50,0 ppb) utilizzando il trattamento con ozono. Inoltre, anche altri studi
segnalata riduzione dei pesticidi nel grano dopo il trattamento con ozono
(Yvin et al. 2001; Pernot et al. 2007a).

La moderna produzione agricola si basa sull'uso di pesticidi per migliorare la
qualità, quantità e diversità dei raccolti. 

Pesticidi agricoli
comprendono erbicidi, insetticidi, fungicidi, nematocidi e rodenticidi

I pesticidi applicati all'agricoltura possono colpire organismi non bersaglio
e contaminare il suolo e i corpi idrici. 

Le implicazioni sulla salute dei residui di pesticidi negli alimenti
e le richieste dei consumatori di alimenti privi di sostanze chimiche e sicuri hanno portato a
lo sviluppo di strategie per ridurre i residui di pesticidi da
materie prime agricole attraverso un post-raccolta efficace e sostenibile
tecnologie

Tuttavia, l'aumento della produzione alimentare in risposta alla popolazione
la crescita e la conservazione degli alimenti senza l'uso di pesticidi e fertilizzanti chimici sono sfide significative.

La domanda dei consumatori di alimenti sicuri con
meno residui chimici ha portato i ricercatori a concentrarsi su approcci più ecologici
alla disintossicazione o alla riduzione dell'uso di pesticidi a un livello sicuro per l'uomo
consumo.

è stato studiato da Ormad et al. (2008). I risultati hanno indicato che l'ossidazione
rimosso il 70% dei pesticidi. 
Ozonizzazione in combinazione con una successiva
coagulazione-flocculazione-decantazione non ha migliorato l'efficienza
dei processi; tuttavia, una combinazione di ozonizzazione con un carbone attivo
processo di assorbimento ha dato luogo alla rimozione del 90% dei pesticidi studiati.
Gli autori hanno concluso che l'ossidazione era il metodo più efficiente
tra le tecniche studiate per il degrado della maggior parte degli studiati
pesticidi.

Poiché l'ossidazione è il principale processo di degradazione per i comuni pesticidi

L'ozonizzazione può essere a
processo sicuro e promettente per la rimozione di pesticidi sulla frutta e
superfici vegetali in condizioni domestiche e industriali.

La fattibilità dell'utilizzo di bassi livelli di ozono disciolto (1,4-2,0 mg/L) per la rimozione dei quattro residui di pesticidi (diazinon,
metil parathion, parathion, cipermetrina) su superfici vegetali (Brassica
rapa) è stato confermato da Wu et al. (2007b). Il loro studio ha indicato che di più
oltre il 60% di cipermetrina e il 27-55% di diazinon, metil parathion e
il parathion è stato rimosso dalle verdure (Tabella 13.3).  Risciacquo a 1,4 mg/L
l'ozono disciolto iniziale per 15 minuti ha rimosso il 27-34% del pesticida residuo.
Risciacquo a una concentrazione più elevata di ozono disciolto iniziale (2,0 mg/L)
ha aumentato l'efficienza della rimozione dei pesticidi al 30-54%. Risciacquo prolungato
a 2,0 mg/L l'ozono disciolto iniziale per 30 minuti ha aumentato il pesticida
efficienza di rimozione al 45-61%. Inoltre, l'efficienza di rimozione di
i pesticidi dipendevano dai livelli di ozono disciolto e dalla temperatura.

Ong et al. (1996) hanno osservato che circa il 53% di azinfos-metil pesticida
il residuo è stato rimosso con il lavaggio con acqua e il 75% con ozono
acqua (0,25 mg/L) rispetto alle mele non lavate.

Hanno osservato diminuzioni del 56-97% nel residuo di mancozeb e nel completamento
rimozione di etilene-tiourea dopo lavaggio con ozono (3 ppm).

In un altro studio, Gabler et al. (2010) hanno determinato l'effetto dell'ozono
fumigazione sui residui di fenhexamid, ciprodinil, pirimetanil e
pyraclostrobin. Hanno osservato una significativa riduzione del pesticida
livelli residui dovuti alla fumigazione con ozono di circa 68,5, 75,4, 83,7 e 100,0%,
rispettivamente, dopo una singola fumigazione con 10 000 μl/L di ozono per 1 ora.

In un'era di alti
domanda di energia, le preoccupazioni globali per il risparmio energetico e una maggiore
tecnologia rispettosa dell'ambiente, l'ozono è destinato a diventare più favorevole
opzione per la rimozione dei pesticidi;
