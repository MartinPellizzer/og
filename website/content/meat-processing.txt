related illnesses:
	- e.coli
	- salmonella
	- campylobacter
	- listeria

strategies to combat pathogens:
	- animal feeding
	- animal sanitation
	- carcass washing
	- primal, subprimal retail

hurdle approach:
	- multiple technologies used in combination during the processing
	  chain

strategies to combat patogens:
	- animal sanitation and chemical dehairing (castillo et al. 1998,
	  xiangwu et al. 2003) to reduce animal hide contamination
	- carcass washing (algino et al. 2009; gill et al. 2000; bolton et al
	  2002)
	- lactic acid application (gill 2009; bosilevac et al. 2006; gill and
	  badoni 2004)
	- acetic acid application (algino et al. 2007; berry and cutter 200;
	  cutter 1999)
	- steam exposure (retzlaff et al. 2005; minihan et al. 2004; nutsch et
	  al. 1998)
	- orgnic acids such as gluconic acid (stivarius et al. 2002b)
	- trisodium phosphate (riedel et al. 2009; rio et al. 2007; morshedy
	  and sallam 2009)
	- hot water (tompkins et al. 2008) 
	- cetylpyridinium chloride (riedel et al. 2009; singh et al. 2005)
	- sodium metasilicate (byelashov et al. 2001; pohlman et al. 2009;
	  weber et al. 2004) 
	- ozone (yang and chen 1979a; novak and yuan 2004a,b; regan et al. 1996)

qualities to preserve:
	- color
	- appearance
	- aroma
	- sensory taste
	- textural properties

organic acids:
	- popular as intervention, because of the pH effect they provide
	  against microorganisms
	- some (like lactic acid) are generally considered safe for
	  consumption
	- they tend to buffer the pH downward
	- can have a negative impacts on meat quality
		- such as colour and lipid oxidation
		- can modify the molecular structure of myoblobin (pigment in
		  meat), causing darkening of color
		- care to lipid fraction, to not promote oxidation, that leads
		  to off-flavour development
antimicrobials:
	- such as trisodium phosphate and sodium metasilacte
	  can shift the pH upward toward neutrality
		- provides myoblobin with the right conditions to make it in
		  vivo (color)
	- cetylpyridinium chloride are classified as quaternaty ammonium
	  compound
		- it doesn't affect pH, so has little impact on meat color or
		  lipid oxidation
	- lasting effects or residues?
		- organic acids leave lasting pH effects, if not buffered, may
		  remain
		- most of them are considered GRAS in meat products
		- with other antimicrobials, residues may remain

Surface decontamination of red meat

Castillo et al. did a study in 2003 
	- to see the difference between washing beef carcasses with water 
	and washing them with a spray that contained ozone. 
	- They put E. coli 0157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium (bacteria) 
	on the carcasses and washed half of them with regular water 
	using a spray that increased in pressure up to 400 lb/in2. 
	- The other half was washed with water that contained ozone (95 mg/L) 
	using a spray with a pressure of 80 lb/in2. 
	- The results showed that washing with the ozone water was just as effective 
	as washing with regular water, but the pressure used in the ozone spray was much lower. 
	- This means that the use of ozone in the water spray allows for a gentler wash.

Gorman et al. did a study in 1995
	- to compare the effectiveness of different antimicrobial agents 
	in killing E. coli on beef brisket. 
	- They tested 0.5% ozonated water, 5% hydrogen peroxide, 12% trisodium phosphate, 
	2% acetic acid, and 0.3% commercial sanitizer. 
	- They put bacteria on the briskets and sprayed them with the different agents. 
	- The results showed that the temperature of the water and the type of chemical used 
	affected how well the bacteria was killed. 
	- Hydrogen peroxide and ozonated water were more effective than the other chemicals 
	in reducing the number of bacteria.
	- The study found that when the briskets were first washed with water and then treated 
	with hydrogen peroxide or ozone, the number of bacteria was reduced
	by 2.60-2.86 colony forming units (CFU)/cm2.
