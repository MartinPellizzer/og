Presenta numerosi vantaggi rispetto agli agenti disinfettanti convenzionali
come cloro, biossido di cloro, ipoclorito di calcio, clorito di sodio,
acido perossiacetico e ipoclorito di sodio.

+2.07 V for ozone
versus +1.49 V for chlorine.

the threshold for Escherichia
coli lies between 0.1 and 0.2 ppm

Viruses are also
sensitive to low levels of ozone, an advantage for an air-based system, since
these small microbes are especially difficult to remove by filtration.

Gram-
negative bacteria are more sensitive to ozonation than Gram-positive bac-
teria and that ozone is more effective against vegetative bacterial cells than
against bacterial and fungal spores
