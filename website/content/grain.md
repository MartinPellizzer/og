# Ozone in Grain Processing

## 6.1 Introduction

Due to its properties, ozone has been used to control pest development in
stored grains, to disinfect flours and to degrade potentially toxic molecules.

It is easily generated onsite where it is used, by either corona discharge
(CD), ultraviolet (UV) or electrolysis of water (Kim et al. 1999), eliminating the need to store dangerous chemicals.

It can be applied in the gaseous
or aqueous state and has been demonstrated to be at least as efficient
a disinfectant as chlorine, and more convenient, because it quickly
decomposes into O2 and hence does not leave residues (Graham 1997).

While it has been approved as an antimicrobial agent by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA 2001) for direct contact with all foods, and
recently approved by the French Food Safety Agency (AFSSA 2003, 2004;
Pernot et al. 2007a) for grain treatment before fractionation, its oxidant
properties (oxidation potential 2.07 V; Guzel-Seydim et al. 2004) and
pungent odour could affect the inner composition and properties of the
treated product; these effects must be evaluated to determine the suitability of ozone for different processes.

Indeed, in nature, ozone has been found to
lead to important metabolic changes in plant cells suffering from ozone
stress (Sandermann 1996; Pell et al. 1997).

Ozone has been shown to react
either directly or indirectly (via the production of superoxide radical ion and its hydrogenated form, the hydroperoxide radical) with many
endogenous compounds in the product (Khadre et al. 2001).

Ozone can for
example react with sulfhydryl-containing proteins (Cataldo 2003), which
are known to play an important role in cereal product quality (Lindsay and
Skerritt 1999).

This review aims to briefly overview the reported applications and
investigations of ozone in cereal grain storage and processing, its benefits
and potential drawbacks for the plant material and products, as well as the effects of process control parameters (e.g. gas flow rate, ozone concentration). The effects on the product characteristics will be discussed.

The potential industry relevance of reported ozone applications and the typical challenges encountered in industrial scale-up of ozone treatment processes will also be outlined.

## 6.2 Ozone application in grain storage and effects on grain components

The control of pest (insects and microorganisms including mould, fungi
and bacteria) development in stored grains after harvest is essential as it
currently leads to a grain yield loss around 3–10% in developed countries,
and can reach 50% in certain countries (Jayas 1999; Fleurat-Lessard 2004;
Magan and Aldred 2007).

### 6.2.1 Insect control

<!-- ! -->
Storage grains are very susceptible to a number of insects, such as
Tribolium, Sithophilus and moths, which cause considerable damage and
which could potentially develop resistance to the currently used
insecticides.

Nevertheless, increasing environmental problems and new
legislation in Europe and the USA, as well as in other countries, tend to
reduce the permitted pesticide amounts (Fleurat-Lessard 2004) or even
ban their use.

Therefore, ozone that can be used in fumigation is an
interesting alternative to applied chemicals for the control of insect
development. However, few studies have been undertaken to precisely
study its efficiency.

<!-- ! -->
Kells et al. (2001) evaluated the efficiency of ozone fumigation in a corn
grain mass (around 9 tons) against adult insects, such as the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), maize weevil (Sithophilus zeamais) and larvae from the Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella).

Insects were put in cages
containing maize kernels and placed into a column filled with grains and
positioned just below the surface.

Columns were either treated or not with
ozone (50 ppm for 3 days or 25 ppm for 5 days) and the number of dead
insects was determined.

Results demonstrated a significant insect mortality
increase (92–100% compared to 3–10% in the control) when the insect
species in grain samples were treated with 50 ppm for 3 days.

S. zeamais
was the most sensible to the ozone treatment. The lower dose was
also significantly efficient but led to a lower insect mortality (77–99.9%
depending on the insect species).

Similar results were obtained by Maier et al. (2006) using identical
conditions but with insects positioned deeper in corn grain samples
(0.6 m below the grain surface) and in the plenum of silos.

The higher
susceptibility of S. zeamais to ozone exposure compared with T. castaneum
was also confirmed later by Rozado et al. (2008).

These authors demon-
strated that 95% of Sitophilus species could be controlled after 24 hours of ozone exposure, whereas an exposure of 64 hours was necessary to
control Tribolium species.

Ozonation conditions were also pointed out to be critical for ozone
efficiency. Kells et al. (2001) pointed out that an apparent air velocity of
0.03 m/s was necessary for ozone penetration through corn grain mass if
a concentration of 50 ppm was used. Sousa et al. (2006) demonstrated the
influence of the corn grain mass temperature over a 24-hour exposure and
showed an increase in S. zeamais mortality when the grain mass
temperature was higher than 35 °C. Indeed, an insect mortality of 12.7%
was achieved at 20 °C, whereas 100% insect mortality was achieved at
40 °C. However, the effect of temperature was not observed for longer
exposure periods.

<!-- ! -->
A similar effect of temperature increase was also observed by Pereira
et al. (2008b), who demonstrated that the required exposure time to kill 50 or 95% of adult insects of T. castaneum with 50 ppm of ozone was reduced if grain temperature was increased from 20 to 30 °C. Furthermore, if an increase of 5 °C led to the same efficiency as at 30 °C, increasing the temperature to 40 °C was proved to be the most efficient.

Potential differences in susceptibility to ozone treatment for several
insect samples from distinct species (T. castaneum, Rhyzopherta dominica,
Oryzaephilus surinamensis) collected in distinct places in Brazil, and
potentially displaying distinct resistance to the widely used fumigant
phosphine, were further explored by Sousa et al. (2008). Efficacy of ozone
against T. castaneum, O. surinamensis, R. dominica was demonstrated with
150 ppm ozone at a flow rate of 2 L/min. Fortunately, the authors did not
find any correlation between the resistance to phosphine and insect mor-
tality following insect treatment, suggesting that the insect defence
mechanisms developed for phosphine resistance are ineffective for
ozone. Indeed, variability in the lethal time to kill 50% of the insect population only varied by 1.6-fold in each species evaluated, depending on
the origin of the collected insect sample. Therefore, because no cross-
resistance between the two gases was observed, as also reported before
by Qin et al. (2003), ozone could be considered as a potential viable alternative to overcome insect resistance to chemicals. However, as it is not
commonly used to treat commodities, real interest in its use remains to
be assessed.

These authors also studied the relationships between the insect respira-
tory rate and ozone efficiency, as it was shown for phosphine that this
physiological parameter is essential for the fumigant uptake. These studies also observed an increase in ozone efficiency related to higher grain
mass temperature that could be linked to a higher metabolic rate of the
insects and thus an increase of ozone uptake. Nevertheless, no correlation
was found between ozone efficiency and insect respiration rate. However,
Lu et al. (2009) demonstrated a two-phase effect of ozone on adult insect
respiration (T. castaneum, S. orysae and Rhyzopertha dominica): a first phase characterised by a lower respiration rate, reflecting the need for insects to reduce ozone toxicity, followed by a second phase where the insect respiration rate increased in parallel to ozone degradation to oxygen.

### 6.2.2 Microorganism control

Fungi development in grains was shown to depend on a number of factors,
including cultural practices and field weather conditions, date of inocula-
tion, resistance of the plant and storage conditions (Edwards 2004; Jouany
2007). The majority of infecting fungi types, such as Aspergillus, Fusarium
and Penicillium, were able under certain conditions to produce mycotoxins,
which have been shown to be harmful for humans and livestock, and
therefore specific regulations are progressively defined in order to determine acceptable concentrations in raw matter and corresponding products
(Murphy et al. 2006; Reddy et al. 2009). After harvest, the fungi growth and
mycotoxin production can be reduced by drying grains or maintaining
a moisture content below 14% and a low temperature of storage (Homdork
et al. 2000; Lugauskas et al. 2007; Magan and Aldred 2007) but this will not
ensure fungi removal, which can only be achieved by grain abrasion (Laca
et al. 2006; Rios et al. 2009). The fungicidal efficacy of gaseous ozone for the
reduction of Aspergillus parasiticus in corn was demonstrated by Kells et al.
(2001). Indeed, a 63% reduction of the fungi load was observed in a batch of
around 9 tons of grains using 50 ppm ozone for 3 days. However, inocula-
tion was done artificially by shaking grains with a conidia suspension.

Inactivation of 96% of nonspecified spores or a mix of spores and a small
amount of fungi mycelia was also demonstrated in barley after 5 minutes
using 160 or 100 ppm of ozone, respectively, as mycelia were less resistant
to ozone (Allen et al. 2003). Allen et al. (2003) also reported that an increase
in water activity and temperature of barley grains enhanced the fungicidal
activity of ozone. In naturally infected barley, Kottapalli et al. (2005) con-
firmed the fungicide effect of ozone on Fusarium fungi using higher doses
of ozone (11 000 or 26 000 ppm), but for a shorter time (15-minute exposure),
and found a statistically significant decrease (24–36% with p < 0.05) of fungi
survival at either gas concentration.

An applied ozone dose of 330 ppm within 5 minutes was found to be
sufficient to inactivate 96.9% of the fungal spores found in wheat grains
(Wu et al. 2006). However, in this case the stored wheat grain moisture
content was enhanced to around 22%. Indeed, an increase in the moisture
content and thus in the water activity of wheat grains was shown to
enhance the fungicidal effect of ozone on wheat grains (Table 6.2); this was also further confirmed by Raila et al. (2006). The presence of water
potentially could accelerate ozone decomposition and thus the production
of oxidant radicals able to react rapidly with organic compounds (Khadre
et al. 2001). Wu et al. (2006) also observed an increase in ozone efficiency
with a rise in temperature from 10 to 40 °C (Table 6.2) when controlling
insect contamination. Additionally, ozone action was found to continue
after exposure because a 30 minute resting time decreased the spore
survival rate by up to 4%.

As wet and warm conditions are the most detrimental for stored grains,
favouring microorganism development, the enhanced activity of ozone
under the same conditions is advantageous. Therefore, interest in ozone
use as a potential fungicide against the main grain contaminants has been
demonstrated, as well as the importance of ozonation conditions in the gas
efficiency for corn, barley and wheat. However, no clear studies on the fun-
gicide effect in relation to the ozone coefficient of diffusion into the pro-
cessed material have been developed and thus the observed effects
depending on conditions, the nature of the grains or microorganisms are
difficult to analyse.

Ozone (from 0.5 to 50 ppm) was also found to be effective in decreasing
the level (at least by a 10-fold factor) of Bacillus and Micrococcus microor-
ganisms which developed on cereal grains or flours during storage (Naito
et al. 1988). Bacteria survival was also affected by tempering grains with
ozone-containing water (1.5 or 11.5 mg/L), as demonstrated by Ibanoglu
(2001). A significant decrease of total bacteria, as well as yeast and moulds,
was reported in both soft and hard wheat-type grains. A more pronounced
effect was observed with soft grains at a higher ozone dose, probably due
to a better penetration and efficacy of ozone in that case. Microorganism
levels were also found to be reduced in flours from grains that were washed
for 30 minutes with ozone-containing water before drying and milling
(Ibanoglu 2002).

Treatment with ozone was also found to reduce maize grain mass loss
even under detrimental high-moisture storage conditions (White et al.
2010). Furthermore, ozone was reported to improve grain drying and thus
could also affect microorganism growth reduction through this indirect
effect (Lauva et al. 2006).

### 6.2.3 Reduction of toxic chemical levels

Due to its inactivating action on fungi, ozone can also be considered as
helping to reduce mycotoxin accumulation during grain storage. Further-
more, its oxidant properties could also be used for mycotoxin degradation
and detoxification, as demonstrated by McKenzie et al. (1997), except
for fumonisin B1, which was transformed into another compound which
was not proved to be safe. Degradation of aflatoxin (McKenzie et al. 1997), as well as trichothecenes (Young et al. 2006), is initiated by the attack of a
double bond with addition of two oxygen atoms, which further leads to
the molecule breaking apart. Young et al. (2006) furthermore pointed out
that trichothecene degradation depends on ozone concentration as well as
on pH.

The suitability of ozone for mycotoxin level control was claimed by
McKenzie et al. (1998), who reported a 95% decrease in the aflatoxin B1
level produced by Aspergillus strains in naturally contaminated corn grains
using around 7 mg/kg of ozone per minute for a 92-hour exposure. These
results were supported by feeding poultry – which are the most sensitive
animal to aflatoxicosis – with either nontreated or ozone-treated ground
contaminated grains mixed with soybean. Indeed, a significant difference of
weight gain between animals fed with the ozone-treated grains was
observed compared to the contaminated grains (Figure 6.1). Aflatoxin-
contaminated corn (1220 ± 73.3 ppb aflatoxin B1) was found to lead to
significant decrease of turkey poultry body weight gain compared with the
noncontaminated control. On the other hand, no differences were observed
if the grain sample was treated with ozone. Furthermore, no decreases in
the relative weight of selected poultry organs such as kidney, spleen,
pancreas and proventriculus were observed in poultry fed ozone-treated
corn, unlike poultry fed contaminated corn, where decreases were observed.

A similar reduction of the aflatoxin B1 level in corn grains was
later reported by Prudente and King (2002) in less contaminated samples
(586.8 ± 50.0 ppb) using ozone treatment. Furthermore, other studies also
reported reduction of pesticides in grain following treatment with ozone
(Yvin et al. 2001; Pernot et al. 2007a).

### 6.2.4 Effects of ozone on grain components, metabolism and physiological status

Since ozone is a powerful oxidant, a number of authors have tried to
determine if its use could lead to potential negative effects on the grain
compounds either by direct comparison of the molecules or via their effect
on animal metabolism.

Effects of ozone exposure on fatty acids and lipids that are susceptible to
oxidation were studied but contradictory results were reported. Naito
(1989) pointed out that potential changes occurred preferentially above an
ozone concentration of 50 ppm and were dependent on raw-matter storage
parameters. On the other hand, Mendez et al. (2003) reported no significant
changes after an ozone treatment (50 ppm) of wheat or corn grains for 30
days. However, these last authors pointed out that the experimental condi-
tions did not allow ozone to penetrate deep into the grains even if the dose
was sufficient to kill contaminating insects.

Absence of lipid changes was also reported by Faroni et al. (2007) in corn
samples treated for 168 hours with the same ozone concentration. These
authors concluded that the quality of corn oil extracted from treated versus
untreated grains was similar, as demonstrated by identical fat acidity and
peroxide values. Prudente and King (2002) confirmed the absence of
changes in either saturated or unsaturated fatty acid levels of untreated or
ozone-treated corn grains, but pointed out a significant increase in palmitic
acid and a decrease in linoleic acid if treated grains were infected with
fungi and also contained aflatoxins. They suggested that the damage
occurring in corn grains following Aspergillus contamination could lead to
an increase in the susceptibility of unsaturated lipids to ozone; however,
the ozone concentrations used in this case were 10–12% higher than those
used by Mendez et al. (2003). Dubois et al. (2006) also reported a slight
decrease in linoleic acid (C18:2) content following ozone treatment of
wheat grains using a higher concentration (12 g/kg). In this case, the
authors also did not notice any increase of lipid oxidation compared with
the water-tempered grains.

Potential oxidation of carotenoids in corn was studied by Wang et al.
(2008). These authors found a significant decrease of the lutein content in
ozone-treated grains (Figure 6.2) that were infected by fungi and contained
aflatoxins. However, they also reported an increase in the level of extracted
lutein from uninfected corn grains, which could be due to an improved
extraction of lutein with ozone. Indeed, lutein could be trapped or associ-
ated with proteins from corn grains and be released by ozone treatment,
which was also found to affect protein level (Figure 6.2).

Other low-molecular-weight compounds, such as B vitamins, phytic acid
and ferulic acid, were compared using untreated or ozone-treated wheat grains by Dubois et al. (2006). No distinct differences were observed, except
in vitamin B5 and B6, which appeared to be lowered.

Dubois et al. (2006) also described changes in enzyme activity following
ozone treatment of wheat grains using ozone concentrations between 5 and
12 g/kg of grains. These authors mainly observed an increase in protease
activity and a significant decrease in lipase activity, which seems to be due
mainly to grain tempering, and was amplified following ozone treatment.
Protein oxidation was also observed by carbonyl group quantification and
appeared to increase after 1 year of storage in the samples treated with the
higher dose of ozone.

However, while these changes could alter the protein and lipid qualities
of wheat grains, they did not appear to affect rat development during a
4-week feeding study (Gaou et al. 2005). Only the following few changes
were observed in rats fed with either untreated or ozone-treated grains: an
increase of rectal temperature in females, a slight decrease of calcium
concentration in males and a slight decrease in certain blood cell numbers
without clinical significances. However, the retained ozone dose used to
treat wheat grains (5 g/kg) in this study was lower than those reported by
Dubois et al. (2006), which showed changes in biochemical composition
and enzyme activities.

Dubois et al. (2008) further studied the relationships between the effect of
the ozone-treatment and the physiological state of wheat grains, pointing
out that ozonation exemplified the genotoxic effects of wheat at a certain
level of germination.

No effect of ozone treatment on corn grain germination was reported by
Mendez et al. (2003) using 50 ppm of ozone. These results were also later confirmed by dos Santos et al. (2007) using 100 ppm of ozone at 4.6 L/min.
Also, Rozado et al. (2008) did not observe any changes in physiological
quality of corn grains following ozone treatment (50 mg/kg ozone injected
at a flow of 0.8 L/min). However, Allen et al. (2003) demonstrated that the
effect of ozone on the germination capability of barley grains was dose-
dependent. If ozone concentration was maintained under 0.98 mg/g of
grains per minute, no effect on germination was observed even after 45
minutes of treatment. However, if the applied ozone dose reached
0.98 mg/g of grains per minute and was maintained in the sealed reactor,
germination capability decreased after 15 minutes of treatment and was
reduced by 28.5% after 45 minutes. Kottapalli et al. (2005) also pointed out
that the effect of ozone on barley grain germination capability could be
more pronounced if grain integrity was affected by Fusarium infection.

Wu et al. (2006) also studied ozonation of wheat grains, and reported that
the effect of ozone on germination depends on the applied ozone dose.
A similar threshold and reduction of the germination ability was found, as
had been reported for barley by Allen et al. (2003).

Violleau et al. (2008) further demonstrated that short-term ozone exposure
resulted in a higher germination rate of corn seeds compared to samples
ozonated for longer periods, which resulted in lowering of germination
levels. In this study, germination tests were undertaken immediately or
after a 48 hour period following the application of ozone at 20 g/m3
for 6, 8 or 20.5 minutes. This increase of germination rate was also reported and
patented by Yvin and Coste (1997) for a number of seeds and bulbs.

## 6.3 Effects of ozone on grain processing, flour and product quality

Mendez et al. (2003) studied the effects of grain exposure to 50 ppm of ozone
for 30 days on the popping volume of popcorn, the milling characteristics of
maize and wheat, the baking of wheat flour and the stickiness of cooked
rice. Contradictory results were reported for popcorn popping volume
between the untreated and ozone-treated grains, depending on their posi-
tion relative to the point of gas entry. However, Mendez et al. (2003) pointed
out a potential effect on the pericarp integrity and grain drying, which
could lead to a significant reduction of the popping volume. No differences
in fraction yield between wet and dry milling of maize grains was observed.

Furthermore, Mendez et al. (2003) did not find any differences in flour
moisture, ash and protein content or colour after dry fractionation of
ozonated soft or hard wheat grains compared to control grains. Additionally,
the bread-making properties of the flour obtained from hard red wheat
grains treated with ozone were found to be similar to those of the control
flour. Adhesiveness of the rice was also not significantly changed by the ozone treatment. However, the peripheral layers which are removed before
cooking were found to be darker than those of the control grains and had
an acidic odour. Mendez et al. (2003) thus concluded that no significant
decrease of grain quality was observed for end users following ozone treat-
ment. However, in the experimental protocol used by the researchers,
layers of different types of grain were treated sequentially by the ozone
flux, which could lead to variation of the received dose of ozone, and could
affect conclusions as to the true impact of ozone on the grains.

Ibanoglu (2001) also reported an absence of changes in flour yield as well
as water, ash and protein content or colour of extracted flour after milling of
wheat grains tempered with ozone-containing water. Furthermore, falling
number, sedimentation volume and rheological properties of the dough were
found to be similar to those of the control grains. Similar absence of changes
in flour yield from ozone-treated wheat grains was reported by Desvignes
et al. (2008) using gaseous ozone at the tempering step, as described in patents
(Yvin et al. 2001; Coste et al. 2004). Moreover, Desvignes et al. (2008) detailed
the impact of ozone on wheat grain dry fractionation. At the higher ozone
dose investigated (10 g of consumed ozone per kg of hard wheat grains),
these authors revealed a significant reduction of coarse bran yield (around
30%), which was balanced by the increase in white shorts yield and sug-
gested that ozone could enhance bran friability or separation between bran
and the starchy endosperm. They also observed a significant reduction of the
energy required for grain milling which occurs after the first breaking step.

Studies of the corresponding grain tissue mechanical properties con-
firmed the enhanced friability of the outer layers and of the starchy
endosperm in grains treated at the higher ozone dose. These changes in
mechanical properties may explain the observed reduction of milling
energy required for grain fractionation. Starch damage was also found to
be reduced in flours from ozone-treated grains, possibly as a consequence
of changes in starchy endosperm mechanical properties and milling energy
reduction. Therefore, one could expect distinct properties of flours obtained
from ozone-treated grains related to water absorption during dough
making and enzymatic degradation with amylases (Mariotti et al. 2006).
This result, however, appears contradictory to those reported by Dubois
et al. (2006), which showed a higher amount of maltose in wheat grains
after ozone treatment at similar levels and conditions. Moreover, while
protein content in flours from ozone-treated grains appeared similar to that
from untreated grains, detailed analysis revealed an increase in the glu-
tenin insoluble fraction (Figure 6.3), which could result from the oxidant
properties of ozone, which is known to have an impact on protein crosslink-
ing (Cataldo 2003). Therefore, contrary to the absence of wheat flour rheo-
logical changes observed by Ibanoglu (2001), dough strengthening was
expected with these flours. Coste et al. (2004), using the same process and
ozone dose range, demonstrated strengthening of dough with flours
obtained from ozone-treated grains.

Ibanoglu (2002) also highlighted changes in dough extensibility when
comparing properties of flour obtained from soft grains milled after
washing with ozonated water or control (water only) for 30 minutes
followed by drying. These differences, however, were not observed with
flours from hard wheat grains treated similarly, suggesting a different
penetration profile for ozone in hard grains.

In corn starch isolation processes, grain steeping in SO2 at levels of
0.1–0.2% can be used in order to obtain efficient starch–protein separation,
and thus a higher starch extraction yield, and to control microbial growth.
However, this process could lead to problematic wastes, toxic both to the
environment and to human health.

Ruan et al. (2004) showed that ozone treatment of corn grains could
efficiently replace SO2 in order to isolate high starch yields. Furthermore,
ozone processing facilitated the treatment of grains at a lower temperature
(20 °C versus 50 °C) and for shorter times (36 hours versus 48 hours)
compared to processes using SO2. However, depending on the ozone application timing, different results were found, suggesting that the
observed effects actually depend on ozone concentration and penetration.
These results are also in accordance with those of Desvignes et al. (2008),
showing that ozone treatment of wheat could reduce the energy input to
process cereal grains. Interestingly, ozone was also found to modify pasting
properties of starch isolated from rice (An and King 2009).

## 6.4 Industrial applications and scale-up

A number of patents have been issued which describe equipment and
methods for employing ozone to decontaminate grains and to modify their
physiological status or technological properties. Yvin and Coste (1997)
described equipment which facilitates an increase in seed germination or
bulb growth using gaseous ozone. Barley and maize grain germination levels
were found to increase after 5–20 minutes of ozone treatment with 1–28 g O3
/kg of grains (O3 concentration in the gas vector 20–90 g/Nm3, pressure of the
gaseous atmosphere in the reactor 100–300 mbar) and with grain moisture
content of around 10–20%. Murphy and Hitchens (2002) described two dif-
ferent devices to treat grains, in which ozone is forced under pressure
through the bulk grain for a fixed duration or is treated during transit from
one storage bin to another. These authors argue that these processes could be
used to reduce mycotoxin level in grains. Vetter et al. (2007) also reported a
system for grain sanitation with ozone in a chamber where ozone concentra-
tion is maintained between 10 and 250 ppm depending on the following
parameters: type of grain, density, compaction factor, moisture content and
temperature. Their design, as well as those reported by Decker et al. (2009),
was clearly defined for grain storage improvement.

In the early 2000s, ozone treatment of wheat grains before processing was
reported to improve flour safety and potentially its technological properties
(Yvin et al. 2001; Pernot et al. 2007a,b). A specific process known as Oxygreen
(Figure 6.4) was developed, which enables treatment of grain with 0.5–20 g
of ozone per kg of grain (80–160 g/m3 TPN ozone in gas vector) for a treat-
ment time of 5–70 minutes. The wheat grain water content is increased after
ozone treatment by around 4%; treated grains generally have an optimal
water content (15–17%) which allows grains to be processed directly by
milling after a storage time of 8–36 hours. However, modification of the
flour properties is dependent on the wheat cultivar and the treatment con-
ditions (Coste et al. 2004; Pernot et al. 2007b). Indeed, the amount and
timing of water addition, as well as the duration of the storage time before
milling, were found to be important parameters to vary in order to control
flour properties.

Ozone treatment generally results in flours with an increased dough
toughness, which is in accordance with the observed effect on the wheat
storage protein network (Figure 6.3; Desvignes et al. 2008). Interestingly, ozone treatment before wheat grain fractionation leads to a reduction in the
required energy for grinding and the resultant flours are slightly enriched
with compounds from the aleurone layer (Desvignes et al. 2008). The aleu-
rone layer is a grain tissue which contains biochemicals that enhance flour
nutritional properties. However, the observed effects on microbial mass or
milling energy reduction could also be partly related to the debranning
efficiency of the ozone treatment under the described conditions (Coste
et al. 2007). This technology has been applied at a commercial scale in
France by Paulic Minotiers and sold under the Qualista brand. A higher
price is paid for flour produced by this technology. However, the actual
amount of flour produced remains low as the mill production rate is limited
to 1.5 T of wheat grains/hour.

Coste and Dubois (2005) reported another interesting potential
application of ozone in wheat flour processing. Ozone use during dough
formation was investigated, with the ozone added through the water
added to flour, yeast and salt mixes, as a gas in the kneader, and through
both methods. The total amount of ozone added varied between 4 and
60 mg/kg of produced dough per hour. The authors concluded that ozone
addition allows a reduction in the mixing time or speed for a similar dough
quality and thus could lead to an energy gain of between 15 and 23%
during mixing. The resultant dough also appeared to develop faster and to
be more resistant to overmixing.

## 6.5 Conclusions

Many studies have demonstrated that ozone treatment can be used to
reduce levels of either biological or chemical contaminants in grains. These
have been reviewed by Tiwari et al. (2010). Ozonation efficiency varies
depending on the nature and state of the target, as well as the ozonation
conditions (temperature, time, water content). In order to improve the
control and prediction of ozone efficiency, an improved understanding of
ozone diffusivity as influenced by equipment design for grain treatment,
the grain tissue structure (porosity) and the ozonation parameters is
needed. Raila et al. (2006) modelled ozone diffusivity in a grain column
(Figure 6.5) and obtained the following equation for ozone diffusion, taking
into account ozone adsorption by the grains and ozone velocity:

Similarly, the effect of ozone on grain biochemical compounds, which
depend on the physiological state of the plant material, ozone penetration
and treatment duration, also needs to be better characterised in order to
control potential detrimental effects. Due to the strong oxidant properties
of ozone, changes in the gluten protein interactions have been demon-
strated to occur. However, an improved understanding of ozone action in
relation to the nature of the raw matter is necessary to define optimal
treatment conditions in relation to the effect of ozone on technological
properties. Sensory properties (texture, taste, colour) could also be affected,
depending on the ozonation conditions, and therefore a balance between
benefits and drawbacks must be analysed for each potential application.
Thus, a detailed evaluation of the ozone effect at each scale (grain, tissue,
molecule), as influenced by the ozonation parameters, must be undertaken.

Furthermore, ozone treatment in some cases also appears to facilitate a
reduction in the required processing energy. However, only a few economical
evaluations of ozone treatment have been reported for grain decontamina-
tion (Pereira et al. 2008a) or for flour production. The price of flour pro-
duced with the Oxygreen process is twice that of flour for untreated grains.

Therefore, ozone treatment of grains or flours has potential industry rel-
evance due to the necessity to control product safety and technological
quality, taking into account the social and economical contexts. However,
the benefits of ozonation must be compared against possible alternative
techniques (as for example for grain or flour decontamination using ionisa-
tion, pulsed light, etc.) in terms of cost, efficiency and potential drawbacks.
Finally, ozone treatment could also be used in combination with other type
of process, as reported by Laszlo et al. (2008), who studied the efficiency of
ozone and UV light in combination to reduce the microbial mass in wheat
flours.
