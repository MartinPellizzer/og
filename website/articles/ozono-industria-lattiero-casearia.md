The European Union's Food Safety Authority concluded in a scientific opinion that "ozone is effective against most microorganisms relevant for food safety" when used within recommended concentrations and contact times.

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global market for ozone generators in food processing is expected to reach $590 million by 2025, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.0% from 2020 to 2025.

Another study published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology showed that ozone treatment significantly reduced bacterial contamination in chicken meat compared to traditional sanitizers like chlorine.
