For the disinfection of the premises and equipment, is used a large amount of
    water 
    steam at high temperatures 
    chlorine-based chemicals

ultra-high-temperature (UHT)-processed milk 
    uses a lot of chemicals 
        (alkaline cleaners, such as NaOH, and HNO3) 
            for cleaning

    This results in further problems and costs for the disposal of wastewater, 
        both for the sanitizers used, 
        and for the production residues.

DAIRY WASTEWATERS -----------------------------------------------------------

Dairy wastewater (DWW) contains high levels of mineral and organic compounds,  
    which can collect in soil and water, 
    affecting serious environmental pollution
    
The huge amounts of wastewater with high organic content must be disposed of 
    and, conventionally, they are purified by physical–chemical and biological methods. 
    
    Some authors reported a generation of 1–10 L of wastewater per liter of processed milk.

About 192.5 × 106 m3 of dairy wastewater (DWW) are generated per year in EU27 countries, 
    49% of which is to produce cheese, 
    19% produce drinking milk, 
    18% acidified milk
    13% are required butterfat products
    
Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the Netherlands produced more than 73% of DWW

The treatment of wastewater with ozone allows for the production of effluents at a level that can be discharged into natural aquatic systems

The common practice for the sanitation of water is the use of 
    chlorine gas (Cl2), 
    chlorine dioxide (ClO2), or
    hypochlorite (ClO−) 
        due to the bactericidal and oxidative properties of chlorine.

The amount of chlorine required for sanitization applications depends on the concentration in water of the species to be oxidized, 
    organic substances, 
    micro-organisms,
    ferrous ions and manganese, 
    nitrites 
    and hydrogen sulfide

the oxidation potential of ozone can lead to peroxidation of cheese polyunsaturated fatty acids



situation --------------------------------------------------------------------

the environmental impact from food production is a global concern, linked to climate change and 


legislation -----------------------------------------------------------------

The legislative framework regulating the quality of water for human consumption has recently been updated 
    with EU directive 2020/2184 of 21 December 2021, 
    which replaces the 98/83 directive.
        The new directive provides for the monitoring of some by-products of chlorine disinfection, 
            such as chlorates and haloacetic acids five 
                (HAA5-monochloroacetic acid, 
                dichloroacetic acid, 
                trichloroacetic acid, 
                monobromoacetic acid, 
                and dibromoacetic acid).


other methods --------------------------------------------------------------

the cleaning of equipment was once completely manual in the dairy sector, 
    using brushes 
    and detergent solutions, 
        and it involved dismantling the equipment to access every surface. 
    
This approach was 
    labor-intensive 
    and time-intensive 
    and often quite counterproductive,
        since contamination can be reintroduced to the system by imperfectly cleaned equipment.

CIP
    These issues were solved by the introduction of CIP (Cleaning In Place) programs, 
        which adopted automated cleaning systems in various parts of the processing plant 
            to achieve the necessary cleaning and sanitation results. 
            
    However, in sanitation systems, it is advisable to try to lower the environmental impact of the various operations.


microorganisms ------------------------------------------------------------

Milk and dairy products offer highly nutritious food for microorganisms to multiply,
    so they can produce spoilage. 
    
The microbial contamination depends on 
    the raw material quality, 
    the conditions under which the products were produced, 
    and the temperature and duration of their storage, 
        resulting in product decay due to contamination by spoilage microorganisms, 
            bringing the product to be unsaleable or greatly depreciated.

In the case of pathogenic microorganisms, the product is not marketable, as it is harmful to human health. 

The control of contamination by 
    spoilage bacteria, like Pseudomonas spp., 
    and pathogenic bacteria, such as Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp., 
    is a big challenge for the dairy industry.

starter LAB ------------------------------------------------------------------

The many varieties of cheese found are characterized by different 
    flavors, 
    textures, and 
    shapes, 
        and are produced using milk, 
        rennet, 
        salt, 
        and lactic ferments. 
        
The microbiota, 
    made up of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), 
        contributes significantly to the quality 
        and safety of the final product, 
        even to the nutritional composition, 
            developing desirable characteristics 
            and flavor compounds, 
                and it inhibits the growth of spoilage 
                and pathogenic bacteria in cheese. 
                
Moreover, their variation leads to obtaining a different quality of the
product and, for this reason, some studies were conducted to isolate microbial strains that were obtained from the best natural fermentations. 

Examples of starter LAB dominant during the fermentation period are
    Lactococcus
    and Streptococcus, 
        while during the maturation process the dominant species are
        Lactobacillus helveticus, 
        Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, 
        Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis, 
        Enterobacter faecium, 
        and Lactobacillus plantarum, 
            qualitatively appreciated by consumers 
                thanks to flavor intensity 
                and texture,
                as well as overall acceptability. 
                
Since the inoculation of starter cultures has been shown by several studies to have a better impact on the overall quality of the cheese, there are commercial starter cultures with which to inoculate cheeses.



transport -----------------------------------------------------------------

The transport of bulk milk from the dairy to the processing plant is critical, 
    as well as the various stages 
        of storage 
        and processing, 
            because it could significantly alter the milk microbiota 
                due to contamination or the growth of microflora.



mites --------------------------------------------------------------------

Product losses also occur due to infestation problems, 
    such as mites, 
        which infest the ripening rooms 
            through the wooden boards used to mature the cheeses, 
                with consequences ranging from 
                product weight loss 
                to the waste of the entire cheese. 
                
The mites are very small, hardly visible to the naked eye, 
    and are practically ubiquitous in the dairy industry and,
    more generally, in the food sectors in which a product maturation phase is foreseen.

They are present in the wooden shelves used in the maturing rooms 
    and spread through the clothes of the operators, 
    or they can be transported by air; 
        dirty environments favor their proliferation. 
        
Therefore, 
    cleaning 
    and disinfection 
        are key operations for food safety,
            but they produce a high environmental impact 
                due to water use and wastewater




chemicals -----------------------------------------------------------------

In the care areas, 
    chemicals such as 
        chlorine, 
        quaternary ammonium compounds
            , etc., are used.

Health and environmental concerns with chemical use on food products or food contact facilities 
    are supporting the need for alternative sanitation technologies. 
    
In this sense, the potential utility of ozone lies in the fact that ozone is a stronger oxidant compound than chlorine,
    and it has been shown to be effective over a wider spectrum of microorganisms.

ozono vs chlorine
    stronger oxidant
    effective over a wider spectrum of microorganism

Furthermore, ozone reacts with some organic compounds in food matrices, 
    and the possible by-products are 
        aldehydes, 
        ketones, or 
        carboxylic acids, 
            which do not pose a threat to human health.





ozone ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ozonation is a clean technique with antimicrobial power 
    due to its oxidation potential 
        able to reduce the microorganisms, 
        limiting the production of enzymes, 
            but the effectiveness of ozone can be affected by 
            the temperature, 
            pH, 
            humidity, 
            and the amount of organic matter around the cells

Unlike other disinfectants, 
    it leaves no ozone residue 
        and degrades to molecular oxygen 
            upon reaction 
            or natural degradation.






The aim of this review is to give an overview of the current state of knowledge on 
    several manufacturing 
    and storage processes 
        of the dairy chain, 
            highlighting the potential 
            and limiting 
                the use of gaseous 
                or ozonated water 
                    against the pathogenic 
                    and spoilage
                        microflora, 
                        parasites, 
                        and insects, 
                        such as molds 
                        and mites. 

Specifically, we intend to start from 
    the raw material of the dairy supply chain, the milk, 
    up to the different final products, 
        including their quality and 
        sensory parameters, 
            passing through the sanitization of the working surface areas 
            and equipment 
            and through the treatment of wastewater.

Some phases within the dairy industry are particularly critical from a microbiological point of view. 
    Examples in the production of cheese are 
        the thermization or pasteurization of milk which must be sufficient to inactivate all human pathogenic bacteria, as well as reduce the endogenous microbial load; 
        the syneresis which may be more or less marked, influencing the aw (water activity index) and therefore the possibility of development of the various microorganisms; 
        the salting phase which determines a change in the microbiological habitat 
            and, therefore, also the variation of the microbial ecosystem (from the population of starter lactic acid bacteria, SLAB, to that of non-starter bacteria, NSLAB); 
        stewing, during which the optimal environment is recreated between temperature and relative humidity 
            for the proliferation of the microorganisms responsible for the acidification of the “pasta”;
        finally, the maturation phase is a fundamental one in which the NSLAB microorganisms 
            will be responsible for the changes that will occur in the cheese and which will influence the consistency, the sensory properties of the product, and its shelf-life. 

For the maturation of some aged cheeses, a further criticality must be considered: 
    the presence of mites,
    arthropods that tend to settle in the wooden boards on which the cheeses are placed to age,
        on which the parasites feed, 
            causing serious economic losses to the companies.


A fundamental element for the control of microbial loads is the disinfection of 
    systems,
    instruments, 
    and rooms: 
        the microorganisms that can colonize environments are in fact many and companies carry out cleaning operations every day 
            using water vapor at high temperature 
            and pressure 
            and chemical products that are chlorine-based; 
                these are costly operations from both an economic 
                and an environmental point of view. 

Furthermore, wastewater is rich in organic matter, 
    an element that makes it difficult and expensive to dispose of, 
    as well as representing an excellent growth medium for microflora.

The genus Pseudomonas includes spoilage bacteria, 
    responsible for undesirable odors 
    and flavors 
    or unusual pigments of foods, 
        often isolated at several stages of the dairy production environment 
            (P. fluorescens, 
            P. koreensis, 
            P. marginalis, 
            P. rhodesiae, 
            P.fragi, 
            P. putida,
            P. entomophila, 
            P. mendocina, 
            and P. aeruginosa) 

The genus Listeria 
    comprises L. monocytogenes, 
        a Gram-positive foodborne pathogen 
            that can form biofilms 
                and persist for a long period 
                    on surfaces 
                    and food processing environments, 
                        being able to cause frequent contaminations of the finished products.

The genus Salmonella 
    comprises pathogenic bacteria found in various types of foods,
        like fresh 
        and fermented dairy products, 
            adapting to an acid environment.

Torlak and Sert [102] studied ozone treatment to eliminate 
    Cronobacter sakazaki 
        (responsible for fatal infections in infants) 
            from milk powder. 
            
            They treated both whole and skimmed milk with different results: 
                for the skimmed milk, 
                    the initial levels of Cronobacter were reduced by 2.71 and 3.28 log, 
                        following an exposure of 120 min 
                            at the concentration of 2.8 mg L−1 and 5.3 mg L−1
                , and the whole milk 
                    sample showed a smaller logarithmic reduction.

Rojek et al. [103] 
    used pressurized ozone (5–35 mg L−1 for 5–25 min) 
        to safeguard skim milk 
            by diminishing its microbial masses, 
                and this treatment looked foremost to decrease the number of psychrotrophs by more than 99%.

Sheelamary and Muthukumar [104] 
    totally wiped out Listeria monocytogenes 
        from both crude 
        and marked milk tests 
            through gaseous ozonation, 
                with a mean viable count of 5.5 and 5.7 log10 CFU mL−1, respectively. 
                
    The results showed complete removal of Listeria monocytogenes 
        after 15 min of treatments 
            with a controlled flow rate of 0.5 m L−1 of oxygen (0.2 g h−1 of ozone).

Cavalcante et al. [101] 
    evaluated in crude milk 
        that ozone gas at 1.5 mg L−1
            for 15 min was found to decrease bacterial 
                as Listeria monocytogenes, 
                Enterobacteriaceae, 
                and Staphylococcus, 
                    and contagious checks by up to 1 log10 cycle.

A study by Alsager et al. [105] 
    analyzed the decomposition of various antibiotic compounds 
        in milk samples by the ozonation process. 
        
        They observed that increasing concentration of gas ozone (75 mg L−1) 
            caused a 95% reduction in antibiotics in milk samples.

This was confirmed by Liu et al. [106]: 
    antibiotic residues in pasteurized milk 
        reach tolerance levels by O3 in a vortex reactor 
            (2.16, 4.54, 
            and 6.12 mg h−1), 
                and no antimicrobial activity was detected in the milk treated. 
                
    The results showed that post-ozonation 
        of 400 mL 
            of 5.52 µM various antibiotics 
                for 20–40 min, 
                    their residue concentrations (50.8–84.1 µg L−1)
                        satisfy the relevant maximum residue limits. 
    
    Therefore, antibiotic residues in milk arrive at tolerance levels by O3 in a vortex reactor. 
        Increasing the input O3 concentration, 
        O3 flow rate, 
        and temperature 
            can accelerate the degradation 
            and shorten the time to meet the relevant MRLs.

de Oliveira Souza et al. [107] 
    studied the effect of gaseous ozone 
        on the inactivation of Escherichia coli O157:H7 
            inoculated on an organic substrate 
        and the efficacy of ozonated water in controlling the pathogen. 
        
    It was inoculated in milk with different compositions:
        unhomogenized whole milk (UHWM), 
        homogenized whole milk (HWM), 
        skim milk (SM), 
        lactose-free skim milk (LFSM), 
        and lactose-free whole milk (LFWM), 
            which were sterilized by boiling in the laboratory to guarantee the elimination of microorganisms 
            and cooled before inoculation. 
    
    Milk was utilized only as a substrate, 
        contemplating the differences in fat 
        and lactose contents. 
        
    The same procedures were also conducted in distilled water for comparison. 
    
    Escherichia coli O157:H7 
        was inoculated in different ozonated water treatments
            (35 and 45 mg L−1 
                for 0, 5, 15, and 25 min). 
            
    In a second experiment, 
        the water was ozonated 
            at 45 mg L−1
                for 15 min. 
                
    E. coli O157:H7 
        was exposed for 5 min 
            to the ozonated water immediately after the treatment, 
                and after storage for 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0, and 24 h 
                    at 8 ◦C.

    The results showed that in lactose-free homogenized skim milk, 
        was observed a reduction of 1.5 log cycles 
            for ozonation periods of 25 min at the concentrations tested. 
            
    Overall, ozonated water was effective in all treatments, 
        but the efficiency of ozone is influenced by the composition of the organic substrates. 
        
    The refrigerated ozonated water 
        put in storage for up to 24 h 
            was effective to control E. coli O157:H7.



The degradation of 
    mycotoxins 
    and aflatoxins 
        is also possible through the use of. 

As reported by Ismail et al. [109] 
    when milk samples were exposed to gas ozone 
        (80 mg min−1
        for 5 min), 
            and aflatoxins were reduced by 50%.

Khoori et al. [110] 
    studied the synergistic effect of ozonation 
        (9.99 mg min−1), 
        UV light radiation (4.99 J cm−2), 
        and pulsed electric field processes (13.15 µs) 
            on the decrease of aflatoxin 
                in probiotic milk. 
    
    Data showed an effect in reducing the levels of aflatoxins
        (total and M1) 
            in acidophilus milk samples. 
    
    Additionally, the bacterial viability was reduced through these methods, 
        with a level of Lactobacillus acidophilus in the final product 
            of 106 CFU g−1.

Sert and Mercan [111] 
    studied the effect of ozone treatment (OT) 
        against milk concentrate (MC) 
        and whey concentrate (WC), 
            evaluating the physicochemical 
            and textural properties 
                and the effect on the microbial, 
                antibiotic, 
                and aflatoxin content. 
                
    The ozone was applied 
        to MC
        and WC samples 
            for 0 (control), 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min. 
    
    The treatment was performed as previously described [112], with some changes. 
    
    Ozone treatment was conducted 
        at 20 ± 2 ◦C. 
        
    An ozone generator with a capacity of 3.5 g ozone h−1 was used. 
    
    The results showed that OT (60 min) 
        reached 18.9 
        and 9.9% degradation of 
            the aflatoxin M1 
                in MC 
                and WC, respectively.

                to 2.37 ± 0.06 log CFU g−1 
                    at time 60. 
        
        For WC samples this decreased 
            from 2.79 ± 0.06 log CFU g−1 
                to 2.04 ± 0.06 log CFU g−1. 
                
        For MC samples, 
            Enterobacteriaceae decreased 
                from 3.33 ± 0.04 log CFU g−1 
                    at time 0 
                to 2.60 ± 0.05 log CFU g−1 
                    at time 60.

        For WC samples, 
            this decreased from 3.17 ± 0.05 log CFU g−1
                to 2.54 ± 0.06 log CFU g−1.
        
        For MC samples, 
            the staphylococci 
                decreased from 2.65 ± 0.08 log CFU g−1 at time 0 
                to 1.89 ± 0.06 log CFU g−1 at time 60. 
                
        For WC samples, 
            this decreased from 2.52 ± 0.03 log CFU g−1
            to non-detectable. 
            
        For MC samples, 
            the total mesophilic aerobic bacteria decreased 
                from 3.39 ± 0.08 log CFU g−1 at time 0 
                to 2.93 ± 0.08 log CFU g−1 at time 60. 
        
        For WC samples, this decreased 
            from 2.93 ± 0.06 log CFU g−1
            to 2.35 ± 0.07 log CFU g−1. 
            
        For MC samples, the yeast and mold decreased 
            from 2.75 ± 0.07 log CFU g−1 at time 0 
            to non-detectable at time 60.
        
        For WC samples 
            from 2.36 ± 0.06 log CFU g−1
            to non-detectable (Figure 3).
