## Consumatori sempre piu esigenti?

I casi di richiami alimentari aumentano. E Le notizie viaggiano in fretta.

Le storie legate alle contaminazioni dei cibi sono ormai all'ordine del giorno. I consumatori sono sempre più preoccupati per la loro salute e pretendono alimenti più "puliti e igienizzati". 

E come se non bastasse...

Non si accontentano di cibi che sono "solo" sicuri. Ma vogliono anche che siano biologici, naturali, e privi di additivi chimici tossici. Esigono una maggiore trasparenza da parte dei produttori, scegliendo alimenti e brands con cura.

Ma se sei un'azienda di produzione alimentare, sai bene di cosa stiamo parlando.

Consumatori sempre più esigenti. Leggi sempre più restrittive. Disinfettanti chimici sempre più scadenti. È diventato frustrante far contenti tutti, risolvere i problemi in modo ecologico e non rischiare di perdere la reputatione per un passo falso.

Ma come uscirne?

### Efficace
L'ozono é un potente agente ossidante (più del cloro).

Elimina batteri, virus, muffe, funghi e altri microrganismi velocemente. Ha un ampio spettro d'azione e abbatte i patogeni sia sulle superfici che nell'aria. Inoltre, è efficace anche contro tutti quegli organismi che hanno sviluppato una resistenza ai prodotti chimici tradizionali.

Infatti, penetra attraverso la membrana cellulare dei microrganismi e reagisce con i vari componenti cellulari (incluso i lipidi delle membrane stesse). Questa reazione compromette l'integrità della membrana, facendola diventare permeabile o adirittura rompendola - eliminando il patogeno.

### Ecologico
L'ozono è un gas naturale e non lascia residui chimici sui prodotti.

Si riconverte velocemente in ossigeno dopo il trattamento di sanificazione. Infatti, dopo 20 minuti circa, già il 50% di ozono si è riconvertito in ossigeno.

Non lascia residui chimici. Non genera sottoprodotti nocivi se usato correttamente. E può anche essere utilizzato per rimuovere residui di pesticidi o altri contaminanti già presenti negli alimenti, negli ambienti di lavorazione e nelle acque di processo.

Introduction

As health and well-being take center stage, This paradigm shift is driving the food industry to adopt rigorous standards and practices to meet the growing expectations of consumers.

Health and Safety Concerns

One of the primary factors driving the demand for clean and sanitized food products is increasing health and safety concerns. High-profile cases of food recalls and outbreaks have heightened public consciousness, emphasizing the need for safe and hygienic food practices. Consequently, consumers are demanding greater transparency from food producers and are seeking reassurance about the safety measures implemented throughout the supply chain.

Changing Lifestyles and Dietary Preferences

Changing lifestyles and dietary preferences also play a crucial role in shaping the demand for clean and sanitized food products. With busier schedules and an increased reliance on convenience foods, consumers are seeking nutritious and healthy options that align with their dietary goals. This has led to a growing preference for minimally processed, organic, and natural food products. Clean labeling, which focuses on transparent ingredient lists free from additives and preservatives, has gained traction as consumers strive to make informed choices about the food they consume.

Social Media and Information Accessibility

The rise of social media platforms and increased accessibility to information have empowered consumers to become more discerning about the food they purchase. Sharing stories of food-related experiences, product reviews, and health tips has become a widespread practice. As a result, any lapses in food safety or quality can quickly go viral and impact consumer trust. This heightened scrutiny has prompted food producers to prioritize cleanliness, sanitation, and ethical practices to maintain their reputation and meet consumer expectations.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly accelerated the demand for clean and sanitized food products. As the world battled a global health crisis, hygiene became a paramount concern. Consumers became more cautious about the safety of the food they brought into their homes, leading to increased demand for packaged, individually portioned, and sterilized food items. Food delivery services and online grocery shopping also witnessed a surge as people sought contactless options to reduce the risk of exposure.

Implications for the Food Industry

The growing consumer demand for clean and sanitized food products has prompted the food industry to adapt and innovate. Food producers are implementing stringent quality control measures, enhancing sanitation practices, and investing in advanced technologies to ensure food safety and minimize contamination risks. Improved packaging solutions, such as tamper-evident seals and eco-friendly materials, are gaining popularity. Additionally, food manufacturers are increasingly transparent about their supply chains, sourcing practices, and ingredient origins to build consumer trust.

Conclusion

The growing consumer demand for clean and sanitized food products reflects a significant shift in priorities within the food industry. Consumers are increasingly conscious of their health and well-being and are demanding safer and higher-quality food options. As this trend continues to gain momentum, food producers will need to prioritize cleanliness, transparency, and sustainability to remain competitive. The industry's response to this evolving demand will shape the future of food production, fostering a culture of accountability and ensuring that consumers can make informed choices about the food they consume.
