customers demand greener food additives
exces ozono autodecomposes rapidly to produce oxygen and thus leaves no residues in foods from its decomposition
ozone as an oxidant is used in water treatment, sanitizing, washing and disingection of equipment, odor removal, and fruit, vegetable, meat and seafood processing
food safety assurance is a global concern
ozone is GRAS (generally recognised as safe) chemical in 1997
approved by the US FDA as an antimicrobial additive for direct contact with foods of all types (FDA 2001)
the use of ozone has been approved in many countries, including USA, Japan, Australia, France, and Canada.

surface cleaning and disinfection
ozone used as an alternative (or complementary) cleaning and sanitizing agent. 
clean-in-place (CIP) offers significant opportunities for food processors (including pharmaceuticals)

food safety and shelf life extension
ozone effectiveness dependent on pH, temperature, relative humidity, additives, amount of organic matter 
storage grains have a number of isect related problems, damaging storing grain, who develop resistance to pesticide
new ledislation will reduce the permitted pesticide amouns (even prohibit it) because of environmetanl problems.
ozone used in fumigation to control insect development, fungi, mycotoxins in grains
degradation of pesticide residues with ozone, including organophsphates and rganochlorinated compounds
used both aqueous and gaseous

nutrient and sensory aspects
taste and sensory properties are the most important factor driving consuption and repeat purchase
meet customers' demands for improved taste and nutrition, ozone may affect those parameters as a oxidizing agent
effects will be dependent upon the mode of application, the dose, food composition and so on

Consumer and processor acceptability
A growing body of consumer research suggests that onsumers are demanding foods which are minimally processed, meet their nutritional and taste desires yet require minimal preparation.

Technology advances
There have been significant developments in the methodologies of ozone production, which make ozonation a more attractive approach for food processing



Environmental impact
issues related to environmental impacts, such as wastewater
and gas emissions, the conservation of nonrenewable resources and energy
consumption, must be investigated and understood by food processors,
since they can represent significant potential reductions in processing
costs

The food industry is a significant
consumer of energy, with the principal type of energy used for traditional
thermal processing being fossil fuel.

Water is a key ingredient in the
food industry, playing a fundamental role in many of the common food
processing methods and unit operations, such as soaking, washing,
rinsing, blanching, heating, pasteurising, chilling, cooling and steam
production, acting as an ingredient, and being used for general cleaning,
sanitation and disinfection purposes.



The hurdle concept



Challenges
Despite significant scientific advances and the demonstrated industrial
potential of ozone in seafood, meat and decontamination of pesticide
residues in the food chain, there is a paucity of reported studies in this area
in general.

Also, the potential for reduced processing costs through the use
of ozone technologies has not been widely disseminated.





regulation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

intro

Ozone has been used commercially for the treatment of drinking water
since 1906 Nice, France (Hill and Rice 1982)

Demand for new preservation approaches arises from growing
consumer preference for minimally processed foods, frequent outbreaks of
food-related illnesses, identification of new food pathogens and the passage
of legislation governing food quality and safety

The World Health
Organization (WHO) identified foodborne diseases as a considerable threat
to human health and the global economy which requires a concerted effort
on the part of three principal partners, namely governments, the food
industry and consumers.

For sanitising applications, ozone may be
preferred over traditional sanitisers such as chlorine because of the
relatively low inactivation rate of chlorine at concentrations which are
limited by regulation, combined with consumer concerns over chemical
residues and potential environmental impacts.

1839 Discovery of ozone by Schönbein.
1895 The molecular formula of ozone determined by Soret.
1886 The potential of ozone to disinfect polluted water recognised in Europe.
1891 Test results from Germany show that ozone is effective against bacteria.
1893 First full-scale application using ozone for drinking water in the Netherlands.
1906 France commissions its first municipal ozone plant for drinking water.
1909 Ozone employed for preservation of meat in Germany.
1914 Research leads to the production of inexpensive chlorine gas and interest in ozone for water treatment begins to decline.

1936 Ozone used to depurate shellfish in France.
1939 Ozone found to prevent the growth of yeast and mould during the storage of fruits.
1942 Ozone used in egg-storage rooms and in cheese-storage facilities in the USA.
1957 Ozone implemented for oxidation of iron and manganese in German drinking water.
1964 Spontaneous flocculation in ozone contact chambers leads to France constructing an ozone
plant to enhance particulate removal.

1965 Ozone employed for colour control of surface water in Ireland and the UK. Ozone used
to oxidize micropollutants such as phenolic compounds and several pesticides in Switzerland.

1970 Ozone exploited for algae control in France.
1982 US FDA grants GRAS (generally recognised as safe) status for ozone disinfection of bottled
water.

1987 600 MGD (million gallons per day) ozonation plant comes on line in Los Angeles after seven
years of pilot testing.

1995 FDA GRAS approval for ozone disinfection of bottled water renewed.
1997 Expert Panel convened by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) affirms ozone
as GRAS for direct contact with foods. FDA does not object to this GRAS affirmation.
Regulators have the option to later add controls on ozone use.

1999 United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) rejects an ozone protocol for meat
application, citing the 1982 GRAS declaration for disinfection of bottled water in which
the FDA stated ‘any other use must be regulated by a Food Additive Petition’.

2000 A Food Additive Petition (FAP) filed by the EPRI requests FDA approval of ozone for direct
contact with foods.

2001 FDA approves ozone as a secondary direct food additive, antimicrobial agent (Federal
Register, Vol. 66, no. 123, June 26).

The American Meat Institute files a letter with the US FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection
Service of the FDA) asking for an interpretation on the scope of FDA rule. In its response,
FSIS determines that, ‘The use of ozone on meat and poultry products, including treatment
of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products just prior to packaging, is acceptable’, and that
there are ‘no labelling issues in regard to treated product’.

2004 FDA issues industrial guidance and recommendations to processors of apple juice or cider
on the use of ozone for pathogen reduction purposes.



History of ozone application and regulation

Ozone was first discovered in 1839 by Schönbein, who observed that the
electrolysis of water produced an odorous gas.

Ozone was first used commercially
as a disinfectant of drinking water in France early in the 1900s

Currently there are an estimated several thousand
drinking water treatment plants in the world using ozone



Overview of US regulations

Ozone is
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the
USA and has been employed successfully for applications including surface
decontamination to extend the shelf life of cheeses and fresh produce,
decontamination of packaging materials, disinfection of process water and
sanitisation of processing equipment and food storage areas, among other
things (Mahapatra et al. 2005).

Ozone is Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS) in the USA for disinfection
of bottled water and as a sanitiser for process trains in bottled water plants
(FDA 1995).

In 1997, ozone was affirmed as having GRAS status for direct
contact with foods by an independent panel of experts,

The FDA
released a final ruling in June 2001, in response to an EPRI food additive
petition, amending previous food additive regulations and granting
regulatory approval of ozone as an antimicrobial agent for direct contact
with foods (FDA 2001).

Ozone is also approved in the USA for use on all meat and poultry
products by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA FSIS 2001)
when applied in accordance with current industry standards of good
manufacturing practice (21 CFR 173.368; FDA 2003).

Enforcement of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA) is under the administrative jurisdiction of the US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA)

The provisions of the FIFRA are written to regulate the use of chemicals that are applied as insecticides, fungicides and/or rodenticides

Because
of the characteristics of ozone (an unstable gas that must be generated and
used on site as it is needed), it cannot be packaged, stored or shipped from
a manufacturing point miles away from its point of use

From the worker safety
point of view, processors must also ensure that plant workers are not
exposed to concentrations of ozone higher than: (1) 0.1 ppm by volume
(0.2 mg/m3 NTP) on a time-weighted average over an 8 h/d basis and
(2) 0.3 ppm by volume (0.6 mg/m3 NTP) as a limit for a maximum exposure
time of 15 minutes, not to be exceeded more than four times daily, according
to US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations
(please see Chapter 14) (CFR 1997).



Ozonation of fresh produce



Ozonation of apple cider/juice

Several incidents of foodborne disease have been associated with juices.
In 1991, an outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections and haemolytic
uremic syndrome was linked to traditionally pressed apple cider. In the
USA 21 juice-associated outbreaks were reported to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1995 and 2005 (Vojdani et al. 2008).
E. coli O157:H7 is an enteric pathogen with a low infectious dose, which
usually causes hemorrhagic colitis but also has the potential to cause
haemolytic uremic syndrome in young children and the immunocompromised
(Boyce et al. 1995).

These outbreaks led the FDA to issue hazard analysis and critical control
point (HACCP) regulations for safe and sanitary processing of juice (FDA
2001).

A primary performance standard is a minimum 5 log reduction of
the pathogens of concern in the juice being processed (FDA 2001).

The
FDA’s approval of ozone as a direct food additive in 2001 triggered interest
in ozone applications.

A number of commercial fruit juice processors in the
USA and Europe began employing ozone for pasteurisation, resulting in
the issuance of industry guidelines. However, these guidelines (FDA 2004)
highlight gaps in the literature with respect to the critical control parameters
of ozone during microbial inactivation in liquid systems.



Overview of European regulations

The interest in ozone as an
antimicrobial agent for food processing is due to several advantages it has
over chlorine and other chemical disinfectants presently and previously
used in cleaning and disinfection operations

These advantages are generally
overlooked by food processors, but the new environmental legislation
emerging in Europe, especially IPPC Directive 96/61/EC, is driving
changes in the food industry.c

Within the EU, among several processing techniques employed in food
processing only irradiation and ionisation have specific regulation and
labelling rules which also vary within member states (national legislation
for irradiation); f

for other techniques, including ozone, no specific legislation
applies. However, there are two general rules which also apply to ozone:

Labelling Directive (2000/13) Indication on the label of the specific
treatment undergone by a product – if the absence of this indication
would mislead the consumer.

Novel Food Regulation (258/97) Premarket authorisation for ‘novel
foods’, including those which have undergone a novel treatment process

The European Council of Ministers has now adopted a proposal which
permits the treatment of natural mineral water, but not spring water, with
ozone, provided that the treatment information is carried on the label.

The
use of ozone is now permitted ‘to separate unstable elements from natural
mineral waters which will ensure that the composition of the water as
regards its essential ingredients is not affected

The unstable elements
referred to include iron, manganese and sulfur compounds.

An important
side effect of this new European permission for mineral waters will be the
disinfecting capacity of ozone treatment, which in many ways is superior
to that of chlorine.

Before the Council vote, the European Union’s Scientific Committee for
Food (SCF) handed down an opinion on the use of ozone to treat natural
mineral waters. The opinion recognised that ozone treatment may lead to
the formation of undesirable byproducts and recommended that producers
should comply with several conditions to minimise side reactions. The SCF
concluded that residual ozone and the concentration of undesirable
byproducts (bromate and bromoform) should be undetectable by the best
available analytical methodology.



Regulations in France

In 2003 and 2004, the French Food Safety Agency rendered two Opinions as
to the safety of the use of ozone as an auxiliary technology to treat wheat
grains before grinding. 

The first (AFSSA 2003) stated that ‘an ozone dose of
12 g (at standard temperature and pressure) per kg of grain, intended for
the preparation of flour for pastries containing simple sugars added to a
level of 7 to 50% of dry weight, does not present any health risk to the
consumer’. 

The second Opinion (AFSSA 2004) extended the use of ozone
from wheat grain treatment before grinding to ‘the preparation of flour
destined for bread and baked products containing up to 7% of added
sugars at a concentration of 8 g ozone per kg of grain at standard temperature
and pressure, exclusive of traditional French bread’, which it described
as posing no health risk to the consumer.



Ozonation of fresh produce

Hammond (2004) outlined the situation in Europe and discussed possible
changes in regulations that may be introduced for fresh produce washing.

The European Council Directive (89/107/EEC) on food additives lists the
substances which legally may be added to food if they perform a useful
purpose, are safe and do not mislead the consumer. 

The detailed controls
made under the Framework Directive are implemented into the national
law of each EU member state and stipulate which food additives are permitted for use, the specific purity criteria and the conditions of use,
including maximum levels for specific additives; however, ozone currently
is not on this list. 

There are opportunities to use other substances for
produce decontamination, providing that they function as ‘processing
aids’, which are defined as: ‘any substance not consumed as a food itself,
intentionally used in the processing of raw materials, foods or their
ingredients to fulfil a certain technological purpose during treatment and
processing and which may result in the unintentional but technically
unavoidable presence of residues of the substance or its derivatives in the
final product, provided that these residues do not present any health risk
and do not have any technological effect on the finished product’. 

Chlorine
and chlorine dioxide, which are used for fruit and vegetable washing, are
regarded as ‘processing aids’. Thus, they would appear to be outside the
scope of the biocide controls as they are ‘defined’ in Directive 89/107/EEC.

Whether a washwater chemical is an additive or processing aid is of
significance, since it is unlikely that a ‘natural’ agricultural product (such
as leafy salad) which carries the name of a chemical additive on the label
will appeal to consumers. Therefore, in practice, washwater decontaminants
must be able to be classed as processing aids, which requires they have no
lasting technological effect on the produce, a key challenge for the chemical
sciences (RSC 2009).

The European Commission is planning to develop more detailed
regulations governing the use of processing aids. Although it is at a very
early stage of development, one possibility being considered is that the definition
of a processing aid will be tightened, so that residues of processing
aids in a final food will no longer be acceptable, unless the substance in question
is specifically authorised for food use. 

Legislation on processing aids is
not yet harmonised at the European Community level, and so processing
aids that may be used legally in the UK and France might not be permitted
in other member states. 

A global approach to processing aids is needed to
control the agents which are essential for the minimisation of the potential
transmission of pathogens from water sources to produce. The risk from
pathogens is not eliminated by using large quantities of water; the risk of
pathogen cross-contamination is only avoided by using processing aids.



Overview of Japanese regulations

In the mid-1990s, ozone was approved for food processing in Japan. As of
2006, there were more than 500 ozone-based gas or water treatment installations
in the food industry throughout Japan, and more than 100 000 food
treatment plants processing a wide variety of foods and food products
(Naito and Takahara 2006). 

This widespread application is a clear indication
of the efficacy and usefulness of ozone in the food industry.



Global harmonisation of food safety regulations

The Global Harmonization Initiative (GHI) was initiated in 2004 as a joint
activity of the US-based Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) International
Division and the European Federation of Food Science and Technology
(EFFoST) as a network of scientific organisations and individual scientists
with the goal of working together to promote harmonisation of global
food safety regulations and legislation. 

GHI aims at ‘Achieving consensus
on the science of food regulations and legislation to ensure the global
availability of safe and wholesome food products for all consumers’. GHI
facilitates global discussion about the scientific issues that support
decisions made by national governments and international regulatory
bodies by:

(1) Providing the foundation for sound, sensible, science-based regulations.

(2) Creating a forum for scientists and technologists to interact with
regulatory authorities, globally.

(3) Providing industry, regulators and consumers an independent,
authoritative information resource.

This global initiative should facilitate the continued adoption of ozone as a safe
and environmentally friendly technique for the food processing industries.

sanificazione ecologica ad ozono per l'idustria alimentare

- why now?

- why ozone?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
l'ozono come alternativa ecologica ai sistemi di sanificazione tradizionali.

Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS) status and US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval of ozone as an antimicrobial agent for
direct food contact (FDA 2001) have allowed ozone to be used in food processing.

Because of residual compounds and reaction byproducts, chemical
sanitising agents have come under scrutiny.

For example, chlorination
byproducts such as trihalomethanes and chloramine compounds are
potentially carcinogenic (Pascual et al. 2007).

Ozone reaction products from
oxidation of organic compounds, such as aldehydes, ketones or carboxylic
acids, have not been reported to have adverse health consequences (Pascual
et al. 2007).

Ozone is also considered as an alternative to chlorine to prevent
the formation of halogenated organic compounds.



The molecular structure of ozone

The strong reactivity of ozone is due to the structure of the molecule. The
ozone molecule consists of three oxygen atoms. In the valence shell of each
oxygen atom are two unpaired electrons, each one occupying one 2p orbital.

This means that during its formation, three oxygen atoms are combined, with the central oxygen rearranged in a plane sp2 from the 2s and two 2p
atomic orbitals of the valence band. With this rearrangement the three new
sp2 hybrid orbitals form a triangle with an oxygen nucleus at its centre; that
is, with an angle of 116° 49′, as shown in Figure 3.1 (Beltran 2004).

At room temperature, ozone is an unstable gas. Ozone readily degrades
(Manley and Niegowski 1967) but has a longer half-life in the gaseous state
than in aqueous solution (Rice 1986). Purity of water usually affects ozone
stability. Although ozone in pure water degrades rather quickly to oxygen,
it degrades even more rapidly in impure solutions.

Hill and Rice (1982)
reported that approximately 50% of ozone is destroyed in 20 minutes at
20 °C in distilled or tap water, whereas only 10% of ozone breaks down in
85 minutes in 20 °C double-distilled water. Ozone solubility in water is
13 times that of oxygen at 0–30 °C and it is progressively more soluble in
colder water (Rice 1986). Ozone decomposition is faster in higher water
temperatures.

Because ozone degrades spontaneously, ozone gas cannot
be stored (Kogelschatz 1988; Wickramanayake 1991; Coke 1993).

Ozone is an unstable gas that has to be generated and applied at the point
of use (Rice and Netzer 1982).


### OZONO COME ALTERNATIVA
L'approvazione di nuovi regolamenti in materia di salute alimentare e di rispetto ambientale, rendono l'ozono l'alternativa migliore ai sistemi di sanificazione tradizionali, come per esempio l'acqua calda e i prodotti chimici.

Essendo riconosciuto come agente sicuro (GRAS) dalla Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), l'ozono puo essere utilizzato per la sanificazione gli ambienti di lavoro, le superfici di contatto, e addirittura i prodotti alimentari stessi.

Questo e possibile in quanto l'ozono e un gas dalla "vita breve". Ovvero, tutto l'ozono prodotto si riconverte in ossigeno in poco tempo, non lasciando alcun residuo chimico sui prodotti.

E data questa sua vita breve, non deve essere smaltito in alcun modo. Di conseguenza, e eco-friendly ed e considerato l'alternativa "green" a quei sistemi di sanificazione tradizionali.

### USA

L'ozono e approvato dalla Food and Drug Administration (FDA) americana per l'uso in diverse applicazioni, incluse:

- decontaminazione delle superfici
- decontaminazione dei materiali di imballaggio
- disinfezione dell'acqua di processo
- sanificazione delle attrezzature di lavorazione
- sanificazione delle aree di conservazione degli alimenti

L'ozono e stato riconosciuto come sicuro (GRAS) negli Stati Uniti dall'FDA nel 1995 per la disinfezione dell'acqua in bottiglia.

Successivamente e stato affermato come GRAS per il diretto contatto con gli alimenti nel 2001 dall'FDA in risposta ad una petizione richiesta dall'Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

La decisione di riconoscere come GRAS l'ozono da parte degli Stati Uniti a trainato gran parte dell'occidente ad accettare...


### JAPAN

A metà degli anni '90, l'impiego dell'ozono nell'industria alimentare e stato approvato in Giappone.

Nel 2006, c'erano gia più di 500 impianti di trattamento dell'acqua ad ozono nell'industria alimentare in tutto il Giappone e più di 100.000 impianti per il trattamento dei prodotti alimentari stessi. 

Questa diffusa applicazione è una chiara indicazione dell'efficacia e della sicurezza dell'ozono nell'industria alimentare.


### EUROPE

Fatta eccezzione per l'irradiazione e la ionizzazione, le altre techiche di lavorazione impliegate nell'industia alimentare non hanno una regolamentazione specifica nell'EU. E tra queste techniche di lavorazione e incluso anche l'ozono.

Ci sono pero 2 regole generali da tenere in considerazione:

- Direttiva sull'etichettatura (2000/13): Indicazione sull'etichetta del prodotto quale trattamento ha subito.

- Regolamento sui nuovi prodotti alimentari (258/97). Autorizzazione pre-commercializzazione per "nuovi prodotti alimentari", compresi quelli che hanno subito un nuovo processo di trattamento.

Il Consiglio dei ministri europeo, inoltre, ha deciso di proporre l'ozono per il trattamento dell'acqua minerale naturale, a condizione che le informazioni sul trattamento siano riportate sull'etichetta.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- safe on food?
- safe on operators?
Ozone is a toxic gas; toxicity is dependent on concentration and length of
exposure (Pascual et al. 2007). At short-term exposure rates of 0.1–1.0 ppm,
symptoms include headaches, nosebleeds, eye irritation, dry throat and
respiratory irritation. At higher exposure levels (1–100 ppm), symptoms
become more severe and include asthma-like symptoms, tiredness and loss
of appetite (see Chapter 15).
