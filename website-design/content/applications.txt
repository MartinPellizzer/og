1. Water Treatment: Eliminates bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other contaminants from water supplies. Reduces chlorine and chloramines levels.
2. Food Preservation: Extends shelf life of fruits, vegetables, meats, and seafood by reducing spoilage microorganisms. Increases storage capacity and decreases need for refrigeration.
3. Swimming Pools: Sanitizes pool water, eliminating bacteria and algae growth. Reduces the need for harsh chemicals like chlorine.
4. Air Purification: Eliminates odors, gases, and particulate matter from indoor air. Effective against mold spores, bacteria, and viruses.
5. Wound Treatment: Promotes wound healing by killing bacteria and reducing inflammation. Enhances tissue repair and reduces scarring.
6. Drinking Water Disinfection: Effectively kills viruses, bacteria, parasites, and other contaminants in drinking water. Reduises the need for chlorine or other disinfectants.
7. Wastewater Treatment: Eliminates organic matter and pathogens from wastewater, improving the quality of treated effluent and reducing the need for chemical additives.
8. Surface Sanitization: Kills bacteria and viruses on surfaces, reducing the risk of cross contamination in food processing plants, hospitals, and other high-risk environments.
9. Green Technology: Environmentally friendly alternative to traditional disinfectants like chlorine and bromine. Does not produce harmful byproducts or residues.
10. Industrial Processes: Used for oxidation of organic pollutants, reducing waste and improving efficiency in various industrial processes.
11. Water Reuse: Effectively disinfects water for reuse in agriculture, industry, and potable water supplies, promoting sustainability and reducing water scarcity.
12. Space Technology: Used to sanitize air and water systems on spacecraft and in life support systems, ensuring the health and safety of astronauts.
13. Food Processing: Used to sanitize equipment, production areas, and packaging materials in the food processing industry, reducing contamination and improving food safety.
14. Aquaculture: Used to treat water in fish farms, reducing the need for antibiotics and improving the health of farmed fish.
15. Livestock Production: Used to sanitize barns, water systems, and feeding areas, reducing the spread of disease and improving animal health.
