Ozone (O3) is a potent oxidizing agent that eliminates various pathogens through different mechanisms:
1. Viruses: Ozone breaks down their protein coats, making them less virulent or inactivating them entirely.
2. Bacteria: Ozone disrupts their cell walls and denatures proteins, preventing metabolic activity and growth.
3. Fungi: Ozone damages fungal cell membranes and inhibits spore germination, limiting their ability to cause infections.
4. Spores: Ozone penetrates the protective layers of bacterial and fungal spores, damaging their DNA and rendering them harmless.
5. Parasites: Ozone can damage parasitic protozoa's cell membranes and disrupt their metabolic processes, making it difficult for them to survive or cause infections.
