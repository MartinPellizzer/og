Here's an example of an `<hero>` section for a homepage about ozone sanitization, with inline CSS:

```html
<section style="
  background-color: #f5f5f5;
  padding: 100px 0;
  text-align: center;
">
  <h1 style="
    font-size: 48px;
    font-weight: bold;
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  ">
    Effective Ozone Sanitization for a Cleaner, Healthier Home
  </h1>
  <p style="
    font-size: 24px;
    margin-bottom: 50px;
  ">
    Eliminate germs, bacteria and viruses with our powerful ozone sanitization services.
  </p>
  <a href="#" style="
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: #5cb85c;
    color: #ffffff;
    padding: 15px 30px;
    font-size: 24px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    text-decoration: none;
    margin-right: 20px;
  ">
    Learn More
  </a>
  <a href="#" style="
    display: inline-block;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    color: #5cb85c;
    padding: 15px 30px;
    font-size: 24px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: 2px solid #5cb85c;
    text-decoration: none;
  ">
    Book Now
  </a>
</section>
```

This code creates a section with a light gray background, centered text, and a heading announcing the benefits of ozone sanitization. The section also includes a brief description of the service, and two calls-to-action: "Learn More" and "Book Now". These elements are styled with inline CSS to create a clean, modern look.

Note that you should replace the `href` values in the `<a>` elements with appropriate URLs for your website. Additionally, you may want to adjust the styling to match your overall website design.
