1. Ozone (O3) is a powerful oxidant and a natural disinfectant, which can destroy bacteria, viruses, mold, mildew, and other microorganisms. It breaks down into oxygen (O2), leaving no harmful residues or byproducts.
2. UV-C light systems use short-wavelength ultraviolet light to disrupt the DNA of microorganisms, preventing them from reproducing. However, they do not kill spores and some viruses.
3. Chlorine and bromine disinfectants rely on the release of free chlorine or bromine ions in water to kill microbes by damaging their cell walls. But, they can leave harmful residues and react with organic matter to form disinfection by-products.
4. Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) is a mild oxidizer that decomposes into water and oxygen. It does not leave any residual chemicals or disinfection by-products, but it can be less effective against some bacteria and viruses compared to other methods like ozone.
5. Silver ionization systems release silver ions into the water to inhibit bacterial growth. They are effective against a broad range of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. However, they may not kill them outright, but rather hinder their multiplication. Additionally, over time, the silver ions can leach out of the system, requiring regular maintenance and replacement.
