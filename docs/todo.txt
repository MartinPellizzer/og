challenges of using ozone sanitization for quality control managers in the food industry?

1. Equipment costs: Ozone sanitization requires specialized equipment to generate and distribute the gas. The initial cost of purchasing and maintaining this equipment can be expensive.
2. Safety concerns: Ozone can be harmful if not used properly or at high concentrations, which poses a risk to workers' health and safety.
3. Regulatory compliance: 
	Ozone is regulated by various government agencies for its use 
	in food processing facilities, including the FDA and EPA. 
	Quality control managers need to ensure they comply with 
	all applicable regulations when implementing ozone sanitation 
	procedures.
4. Training requirements: Workers must receive proper training on how to handle and operate ozone generators safely.
5. Monitoring effectiveness: It can be challenging to determine whether ozone has effectively sanitized surfaces since it's odorless and colorless.
6. Compatibility issues: Certain materials (such as rubber) may degrade quickly when exposed to high levels of ozone gas over time, making it important for quality control managers always check material compatibility before implementing any new cleaning methods involving this technique.
