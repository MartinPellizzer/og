disinfectants such as ozone can be manufatured, place on the market, and used
in the european union exclusively on the basis of an authorization issued
under regulation 528/2012 and under the national legislation currently in
force in each member state.

there are also directives on some specific uses of ozone, such as the
directive 2003/40/ec that defines the conditions for using ozone-enriched air
for separating compounds of iron, manganese, sulfur, and arsenic from natural
mineral waters or spring waters, and the labeling requirements for waters
which have undergone such treatment.
